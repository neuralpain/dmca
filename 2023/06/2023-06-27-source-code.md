This user was part of the organization. We are still investigating which employee was the culprit. We only allow access to employees and contractors with strict non-disclosure agreements, and we always ensure permission is extremely limited to associates that are trustworthy with strict contractual agreements.

There are no forks, only one main branch. None of the individual infringing repositories have forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
