**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am [private] of ByteDance who is the copyright owner of a SDK called "VESDK".  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
The copyrighted work in concern is a SDK called “VESDK”, which was originally created by ByteDance's [private] team in 2019. Accordingly, ByteDance owns the copyright in VESDK. This SDK is designed to present video effects in smartphone cameras' short video modules. In early 2019, ByteDance licensed a client to install its VESDK in the client's smartphone camera. In the license agreement, ByteDance retains its copyright in the SDK and does not authorise the client to disclose the related source code. We recently noted that a large portion of our VESDK was reverse-engineered and uploaded on GitHub by the Respondent. In particular, we should note that the reported source code even contains our domain "toutiao.com" and our brand "DOUYIN". However, we have never authorised the Respondent to copy or publish our VESDK. Consequently, the reported content constitutes copyright infringement upon our VESDK.
