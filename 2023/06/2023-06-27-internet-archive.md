**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] at Internet Archive. We use industry standard technical protection measures (TPMs) to prevent the unauthorized download of copyrighted books. This DMCA complaint is about a tool made available on github which purports to circumvent technical protections in violation of the copyright act section 1201. As such, I am not authorized by the copyright owners, but I am acting on behalf of our duty to prevent the unauthorized downloading of these protected materials.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am reporting a Git which provides a tool specifically used to circumvent industry standard library TPMs which are used by Internet Archive, and other libraries, to permit patrons to borrow an encrypted book, read the encrypted book, and return an encrypted book.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/bipinkrish/DeGourou

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The industry standard tool being exploited by the reported Git is the Adobe adept protocol, used in the Adobe Digital Reader. It facilitates library lending of encrypted books.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The reported Git impersonates an Internet Archive ereader by checking out a book from Internet Archive and fraudulently unlocks the Adobe encrypted book. Then they have a method whereby it then captures the book as an unencrypted PDF which has no technical controls. The Git’s author explains in very clear terms this is an anti-circumvention tool in the About section: “Automate the process of getting decrypted ebook from InternetArchive without the need for Adobe Digital Editions and Calibre.” (emphasis added). This tool facilitates “decryption” of encrypted library ebooks and is a violation of U.S. copyright section 1201.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I am not aware of any.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
