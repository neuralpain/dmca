**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We discovered that #3 repositories that are own by Baker Hughes company had PUBLIC visibility. Those repositories are located on the account of former BH employee (no longer in the Baker Hughes company, so we cannot ask her for change).

The repositories contain sensitive and confidential data from Baker Hughes regarding gas turbine contract details.
