Hello,

My name is [private], and I am the authorized representative on behalf of our client Samba Financial Group. 

Infringing URLs: hxxps://basharshamaly[.]github[.]io/bank-system/  
IP Address: [private]

Please find below points related to DMCA Notice:

The above page uses Samba Financial Group property in its content without authorization. 
This use falsely suggests Samba Financial Group's sponsorship or endorsement of the Trademark and logo, which violates Samba Financial Group's exclusive rights.
This would not be considered 'fair use' as the form looks fraudulent, attempting to steal account information from the targeted victims.  
The title of the form is 'Your refund is automatic' (translated from Arabic)  
Even if the form does not have a script running at the backend, that does not guarantee that it will not be updated in the future.

I am attaching a screenshot of the infringing form for your reference.

This email is an official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice, inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material directly, and notify them to cease any further posting of the infringing material to your server.

Please also be advised that the law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or restrict access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under US law, a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify 
ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate, remove, or disable the infringing material, this immunity is lost. Therefore, for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action, you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise turn off the infringing material from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that my company's rights are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury, I certify that the information in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the copyright owner (s) involved.

Should you wish to discuss this with me, please get in touch with me directly.
