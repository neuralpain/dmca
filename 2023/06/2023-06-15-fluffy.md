Dear GitHub Team,

 

I am writing to submit a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice regarding the unauthorized replication, hosting, and distribution of proprietary software and designs on your platform. I have identified a GitHub account that contains source code and design assets which belong exclusively to me, and they have been hosted and/or published without my consent or authorization.

 

Here are the details of the infringement:

1. Nature of the Infringement:

· Unauthorized Use: The source code for my proprietary software has been replicated, uploaded, and hosted on the GitHub account in question, owned by an individual who did not have any access to the project.

· Unauthorized Sharing of Designs: Additionally, the designs for the software interface have been shared with individuals who also did not have any access to the project.

 

2. Background Information:

· Developer Hire: I hired a software developer from [private] to create custom software for me, and I ensured that he signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

· Shared Information: I shared detailed instructions on how the software should function and provided the designs for the software interface with the hired developer.

· Delivery and Payment: The developer delivered the software as requested, and I duly compensated him for his work.

 

3. Evidence:

· Proof of Ownership: I am the rightful owner of the proprietary software and possess the necessary documentation and proof of development.

· Unauthorized use: The proprietary software has been replicated, uploaded, and hosted without permission on the following Github repositories:

o   [invalid]

o   [private]

· Connections to the Developer: After conducting an investigation, it became apparent that the individuals who now have access to the software and designs have connections to the developer I hired.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. The continuation of this unauthorized distribution poses a significant threat to my intellectual property rights and business interests.
