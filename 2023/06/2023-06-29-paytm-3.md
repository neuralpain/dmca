Greetings,

I am [private] from iZOOlogic Ltd., a private security company authorized to represent Paytm.

We're reaching out to report a file uploaded on Github by a nonaffiliated user, as mentioned and confirmed by our client Paytm.

Account Uploader: https://github.com/hell-o-wor-ld

Infringing Content: https://github.com/hell-o-wor-ld/paytmclone

The reported repository has copied all the structures of the official website of our client Paytm, and it replicated the site as what the original website looks like; as you can see from the contents, page structure, UI/UX, and page orientation, it's the same as the official page of our client. This could be used as a fake website to conduct fraudulent activity among the customers or clients of Paytm.

Copyrighted Material: https://paytm.com/

Please note that we are claiming copyright for the whole repository as this is a complete unauthorized copy of the Paytm website https://paytm.com/ which our client Paytm owns.

We request your quick action to remove the Infringing repository immediately. This immediate action will guarantee that the spread of continuous fraudulent activities will permanently cease as an authority and governing body regulating your region's internet.

I have a good faith belief that the use of the trademark described above is not authorized by the trademark owner, its agent, or the law. I have considered nominative and other fair services.

And under penalty of perjury, I swear that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the trademark owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Please let us know if you have any queries.

Regards,

[private]
