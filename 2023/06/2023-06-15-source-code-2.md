While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright owner of the code in question.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is code [private] as part of Programming Assignments and Projects [private] in a university course [private]. The user who I am alleging violated copyright was only given permission to use that code within the course while they were a student, and posting the code publicly is a copyright violation (this policy was made clear in the course agreement the user explicitly agreed to while taking [private]). I am claiming that the entire directories listed below (not just individual files, but the entire directories) are infringing upon the original work I identified in the previous section of the notice. All of the code files in each of the listed repositories are derivatives of closed-source code for which I own the copyright. Specifically, students in [private] are given closed-source starter code (for which I personally own the copyright as the original developer), and they make small modifications to the starter code files to solve the homework assignments. None of the files in any of the listed repositories are the student's completely original work: they are all derivatives of my copyright closed-source starter code, and as such, cannot be released with an open source license.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Students are only able to access my copyrighted material if they are enrolled in [private] course, and the code is only made available within the LMS environment.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The student copied the code from the LMS environment and uploaded to their GitHub repos.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I searched for forks but did not find any.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
