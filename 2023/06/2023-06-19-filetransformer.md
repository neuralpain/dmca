**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

A project named FileTransformer that I and published on GitHub under the GPL v3.0 license a few years ago: https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/FileTransformer

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The user "kntjsprr" made a copy of my "FileTransformer" project, made a few minor modifications (mainly interacting with it with CLI instead of a GI interface), and re-released it with a new name and no credit.  
The code is a complete copy of mine, besides a few small modifications.

The main code file on my project:

https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/FileTransformer/blob/main/FileTransformer/FileTransformer.cs

The main code file on his (which you can see is almost the same):

https://github.com/kntjsprr/Citadel/blob/main/CitadelMain.cs

His README file (https://github.com/kntjsprr/Citadel) also includes an image describing the file format that I made and included in my project's README (https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/FileTransformer).

He asked me to help him resolve an issue on my own repository 5 days before opening his "project" (this is just an additional proof):

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/kntjsprr/Citadel

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There seem to be no forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GPL v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

GPL v3.0 states under "Conveying Modified Source Versions" that "a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.", which this user didn't.

There is no mention of the original source (mine).

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Adding a disclaimer on his project's README, and on source files that use my code, that state that the code is a modification of my project, with a link to it. Making it private / removing it are alternative solutions.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Any of the aforementioned solutions are fine by me.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
