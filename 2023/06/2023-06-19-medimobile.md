I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I would like for [https://rayyane.github.io/medimobile/ to](https://rayyane.github.io/medimobile/to) be taken down. It is work done by a contracted freelancer that ended up not being used. They were compensated for their work but it is not our live website. It is now causing problems for our existing customers because they are confused if this is our website as it is high ranked on SEO because of Github. It uses our company name, logo, copyright information, and our technology and patents. It uses employee's names on the website. It also includes false placeholder information which is damaging to healthcare systems if they think it is correct. The site needs to be privatized/unpublished. We have submitted a claim in the past and nothing as been done. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

Our real website can be found at medimobile.com
