I am [private] from iZOOlogic Ltd., a private security company authorized to represent Paytm.

We're reaching out to report a file uploaded on Github by a nonaffiliated user, as mentioned and confirmed by our client Paytm.

https://github.com/avhadaniket/paytm-clone/blob/Aniket_Dev/index.html 

We are claiming copyright for the whole repository as all the files, the index files and all the contents on the folder are a direct copy of the Paytm main and landing page and assets taken directly from the websites. Our client Paytm requests to remove the infringing content to prevent any fraudulent activity that could be done by the repository created on your platform of a non-affiliated user.

Original Landing Page Copyrighted: https://paytm.com/

Please note Paytm has not authorized the user to copy the main landing page of Paytm as it can be used to analyze vulnerabilities and company secrets and create duplicate or phishing sites aiming for Paytm customers.

We request your quick action to assist in removing this Infringing Content as soon as possible. This immediate action will guarantee that the spread of continuous fraudulent activities will permanently cease as an authority and governing body regulating your region's internet.

I have a good faith belief that the use of the trademark described above is not authorized by the trademark owner, its agent, or the law. I have considered nominative and other fair services.
