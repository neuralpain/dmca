Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 900 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

Note: Because the parent repository was actively being forked when this DMCA takedown notice was received, and the submitter had identified all known forks at the time they submitted the takedown notice, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 45 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

Infringement as authorized in 512(c) of the U.S. Copyright Law.  
  
I am the copyright owner of the works and the following is true and accurate.  
  
I own full rights to these videos. I also have 2257's, ID's and model releases for them. I also have signed documents from the original producer(s) certifying I own them.
