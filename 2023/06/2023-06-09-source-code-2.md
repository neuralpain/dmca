While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] at the Maricopa County Community Colleges in [private] ([private], [private], [private], [private] and [private]). This is code to the assignment [private] give students in [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I can provide the files [private] give students. The files are not posted online because they are a class assignment.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This file specifically is the file that needs to be removed. https://github.com/dav2113534/Saurian-Translator/blob/master/Saurian.java Alternatively, the user can make the repository private and that would be acceptable as well. The Saurian.java file should not be available publicly.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

There is a disclaimer placed inside the assignment code that [private] provide to students. It looks like this:

// Disclaimer:  
// The given assignment description, project files, code files and/or solution files  
// should not be made available in a public form via methods such as online hosting  
// in code repositories, educational resource hosting websites, etc. These projects  
// and related files can be hosted in private repositories for situations such as  
// showing example work at job interviews, personal reference for future class  
// projects, etc.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project seems to have removed the disclaimer.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not found forks yet, but if I encounter them I will request that they be removed as well.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Yes, but I can't provide it because of FERPA.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
