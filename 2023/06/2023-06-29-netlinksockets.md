**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GPL-3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

https://github.com/Lichtso/netLink is a derived work from Netlink Sockets C++ and therefore must be under GPL-3.0 license.  
See the first commit as proof: https://github.com/Lichtso/netLink/commit/d39815b17fb8f24d9727442ea4ba26f6293b7bc4
In the current version the original headers (with the copyright notice and the GPL license) of the files has been removed and replaced for another header with only the attribution of the entire copyright of the project to the repository owner. I think these changes to the file content headers have been made in bad faith.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Set the GPL-3.0 license to the project and keep the original headers of the files.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
