Hello dear Github: I am [private]. It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficent platfrom, and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution. I have read and understand Github's Guide to filling a DMCA notice.

I created a Repository called [invalid], which contained creators, contents source code and system configuration informationare all owned by the company. Later found that before I deleted, the user named bellmit completely forked our entire Repository, and it still exists.

https://github.com/bellmit/mystudycode

Before, and worse, I couldn't contact him.

Since https://github.com/bellmit/mystudycode contains the campany's important source code and system configuration information,belonging to the company's internal data assets. So I hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove https://github.com/bellmit/mystudycode and thank you very much.  
The following is my contact information:
