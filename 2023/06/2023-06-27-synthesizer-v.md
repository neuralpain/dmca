I am writing on behalf of Dreamtonics Co., Ltd.(Dreamtonics), a [private] startup specializing in the development and
distribution of text-to-speech and music software solutions. We have identified a copyright infringement issue with content currently
being distributed on your platform. The matter in question is a crack tool to circumvent the copy protection of

I, [private], have been delegated for the communication with you on this infringement case by Dreamtonics Co., Ltd.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our software requires an activation code issued by us to run. Activation codes entered by the user will be verified through our server. For valid activation codes, our server issues a device-specific product key which the client keeps for offline authentication.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The project in question acts as a launcher to our software that scans the memory and replaces our public key with a self-issued key. The project in question also modifies program data to be consistent with the self-issued key.

We have not yet found any forks of the infringing file/repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No
