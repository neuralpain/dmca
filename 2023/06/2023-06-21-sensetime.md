Source codes and all information of the above registered copyright, which are all developed by SenseTime itself and should be proprietary and confidential, were released by a certain third party (Github user “AyraHikari”) and posted into repository in Github without authorization.

We confirm that all files in the URL as provided below infringe SenseTime’s registered copyright and hope them to be removed ASAP. Specific links to the infringing files to be removed are:
