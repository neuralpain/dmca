**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I’m [private], [private] at FLO HEALTH group of companies and I’m duly therefore authorized to act on behalf of FLO HEALTH INC. (a legal entity dully incorporated under the US laws).  
FLO HEALTH INC. is a copyright owner of the app Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker for iOS (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flo-period-ovulation-tracker/id1038369065) and Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.iggymedia.periodtracker&hl=en&gl=US) which is clearly indicated at the respective pages of apps in AppStore and Google Play.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Original copyrighted work is Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker Premium mode, which is basically available for users who pay for Premium subscription on iOS (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flo-period-ovulation-tracker/id1038369065) and Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.iggymedia.periodtracker&hl=en&gl=US).  
There exist free official versions of Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker for iOS and Android, but Premium mode (subscription) of Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker contains much more unique content and provides users with additional features, such as:

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

FLO HEALTH INC. uses technological measures that effectively control access to Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker Premium subscription (that is, to works protected by copyright). Such measures are SSL/TLS to protect application network traffic and subscription validation on server-side. Backend services check for user’s subscription and this effectively controls access to the copyrighted material.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is designed to circumvent the previously described technological protection measures as project intercepts response from our service and changes it, a changed response tricks application to Flo Premium mode.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?
