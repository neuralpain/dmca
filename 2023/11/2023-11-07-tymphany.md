Copyright of the entire source code which I'm submitting a DMCA takedown to, belongs to Airoha Technology, which is an IC design house company in Taiwan. Tymphany HK Limited. is [private] company, we are a manufacturer for audio related products.
Airoha is one of the most important IC provider for us, we purchase Airoha ICs, design product based on Airoha platform, and have access permission to part of their source code/SDKs based on NDA (non-disclosure agreement) and SLA (service-level agreement).

As you can see this repo even has [private] name and [private] commit history, which is not authorized by [private] or [private] company to own the source code or to share to the public. I believe yao2015lin is also not authorized to have Airoha AB1585 SDK, all copyright belongs to Airoha.
