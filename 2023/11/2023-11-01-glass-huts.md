Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,

 

This is [private], representing and [private] of The Glass Huts. I am writing to formally request the removal of content on GitHub that infringes upon our copyrighted website design and unauthorized use of our email addresses. I've previously communicated my concerns to GitHub Support, but given the urgency and gravity of the matter, I'm now escalating this through the proper DMCA process.

 

1. Identification of copyrighted work:  

We are the exclusive owners of the website content, design, and assets hosted at https://glashytterne.dk/ and www.theglasshuts.com.

 

2. Identification of the infringing material:  

Three repositories on GitHub are infringing upon our rights by replicating our website's design and misusing our email addresses, potentially for malicious activities. 

 

The repositories in question are:  

- https://github.com/Egas099/landing-page-the-glass-huts

- https://github.com/NadyaLenkovets/Glass-Hut  

- https://github.com/Vitals13/huts

 

3. Contact information: 

- Full name: [private] 

- Address: [private], [private], [private] 

- Phone number: [private] 

- Email address: [private]

 

4. Statement of good faith: 

I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material described above is not authorized by us, its agent, or the law. Additionally, I have taken fair use into consideration in making this claim.

 

5. Statement of accuracy: 

I affirm, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notice is accurate. We possess unequivocal rights to all content, design, and assets of our website, and we're prepared to present evidence to validate our claims, if necessary.

 

6. Action Requested:  

I respectfully request that: 

- Our email addresses ([private] and [private]) be immediately extracted and removed from these repositories.

- All design elements, graphics, assets, or any content in these repositories that resemble or directly replicate content from our website be removed.

 

7. Regarding Forks:  

Given the potential for forks of these repositories, we believe that all or most of the forks, if any, are infringing to the same extent as the parent repositories. We request that these be addressed as well.

 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and trust in your immediate action to address these concerns, thus preventing further infringements of our intellectual property and misuse of personal data.

 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

 

Best Regards,

 

[private]  

The Glass Huts
