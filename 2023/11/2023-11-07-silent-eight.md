One of our former [private] share our IRIS [private] (here: [private]) in public by mistake and next the mentioned in request user copied it to his repo (here: https://github.com/TristinDavis/iris-root).

In the first situation (former [private] unathorized sharing) we have contacted with him and remove / hide this [private], but in the second situation we don't know this user and we cannot contact with him. So we report it by DMCA takedown form.
