RE:  DMCA Notice of Circumvention Technology Services Hosted by GitHub.com --

Forked/cloned from [private] - 11 forks

 

Dear GitHub, Inc.:

 

On behalf of The MathWorks, Inc. ("MathWorks") and pursuant to Sections 512(c)(3) and 512(d)(3) of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) and 512(d)(3)), I am writing to place you on notice of circumvention services in 11 forks of a certain repot that until recently was offered on the GitHub.com web site at the URL [private].   MathWorks recently submitted a DMCA takedown request for this parent repo, which request has been granted.  See https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2023/10/2023-10-30-mathworks.md

 

However, we now understand that there were at least 11 forks that clone/reproduce all the content of that original, parent repo.  We have reviewed each fork and each fork has the same content as and shows the same initial and single commit date as the original, parent repo above.  We are now writing to ask you, consistent with the DMCA, to please take down these 11 forks, which are listed immediately below:

 

https://github.com/zhaoshuaicqupt/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/coshnnui/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/GUNIITT/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/majkhan79/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/JasonShen1989/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/lishang6257/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/Luisal11/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/rmd13/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/StephaneRenouard/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/tongyao111/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
https://github.com/xpology/matlab-pcode-decompiler  
 

I have a good faith belief that use of the circumventing services described and offered on the above infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  Specifically, I have a good faith belief that the services identified above violate at least 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2) and/or 1201(b)(1) as to circumventing effective access controls and copyright protection measures of works protected under Title 17 of the United States Code, such access controls and protection being provided by MathWorks' MATLAB® computer program for user created MATLAB programs and related toolbox add-on computer programs.  In particular, the above referenced repos offer services to circumvent MATLAB® pcode capability, which allows a MATLAB user, including MathWorks, to obfuscate his or her MATLAB code using a MathWorks proprietary, obfuscating code format that MathWorks makes available in its products via an anti-circumvention capability.  See https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pcode.html  

 

The MATLAB® pcode capability allows a MATLAB user to share their original MATLAB® code file functionality with other users while protecting the author’s underlying code file’s expression (intellectual property) through a proprietary obfuscation process.  The above referenced GitHub repos are offering services (for a “donation”) to de-obfuscate MATLAB® pcode files that have been subject to the technological measures applied by the MATLAB® pcode capability to control access to the author’s underlying protected file.  See the ReadMe file for each repo, e.g., https://github.com/zhaoshuaicqupt/matlab-pcode-decompiler/blob/master/README.md

These offered de-obfuscating/unscrambling services made available by the above referenced GitHub repos are unauthorized.

 

I have taken fair use into consideration. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA

Notice. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed, including the pcode anti-circumvention capabilities referenced above. 

 

Please act expeditiously to take down these materials as soon as possible.

 

If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact me at the telephone number, email address, or postal address indicated below. Thank you.

 

Sincerely,
