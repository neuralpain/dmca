- Description of the copyrighted software:  
Disclosed are methods and systems of a network security appliance to imitate a wireless access point of a local area network through coordination of multiple radios. In one aspect, a network security appliance includes (1) at least one supporting radio and (2) a communication radio. The at least one supporting radio determines if an access point is available in a local area network through a sniffing algorithm, determines if a client device is visible in the local area network, and injects at least one data packet into the client device based on either a command from an operator of the network security appliance and/or an automatic algorithm determined based on a set of preferences. The communication radio wirelessly imitates the access point of the local area network such that the client device is connected to a wide area network through the communication radio that is wirelessly imitating the access point.
