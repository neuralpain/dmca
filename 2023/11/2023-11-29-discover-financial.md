I work for Discover Financial Services, [private], [private] and an alert was sent to our [private] letting us know that strings related to DFS were found on multiple related public Github repositories. I am investigating the case and am responsible for containing and remediating this by asking for at least the files with the references to be removed, but would prefer whole repositories to be removed as they most likely also contain copied DFS code. Our Investigation found that an unidentified person or persons cloned an internal repository, modified it and placed in on their own public repositories.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Several Personal Github repositories have a clone of a private internal Discover Financial Services Github code repository on them with internal private DFS hostnames within.  
Relevant snippet of code showing it could only have come internally from DFS:  
target: '[private]'

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

DFS would prefer that whole repositories be removed as they are all most likely taken from DFS:

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No but this person is identified as making changes to the repository: [private]
and they are a contractor for a company who does work for DFS named "[private]". However, they deny he did it and claim his account was hacked and he has no knowledge of interacting with this code. We were unable to match "[private]" to any know DFS employee or contractor name.
