Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Not relevant in this context, Please note that the content listed above and made available by Github was copied onto your servers without permission. Hence, this website is infringing on several copyrights owned by Vector Informatik GmbH.

We seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. We request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Why would that be relevant? It's quite simple an un authorized use of our software and therefore a breach of an agreement which we will deal with separately with our customer licensee. Still, we take care of our property ourselves and wouldn't leave this to our no longer very much trusted customer.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

No

Reported content must be removed
