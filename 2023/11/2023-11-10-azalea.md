**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright holder and owner of the repository in question.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work in question is a project called [Azalea](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea) which is a Chrome extension of sorts that adds extra functionality to a British Mathematics Homework website called SparxMaths. It includes features such as themes, automatic answer storing (called bookwork-bypass in the source code), etc. It has existed since before Sparx redesigned the internal code of their React-App, and this is shown by the fact that there are 2 branches, sparx-v2, the current branch, and sparx-v1, the legacy branch for the pre-rewrite.

The extension features an API in the window for interacting with the code added to the website, as well as fully bundling and compressing the codebase in a GitHub workflow. The code also features a robust system for rendering Katex and Text in the same string, a refactor of Sparx's original system for doing so.

The project was originally licensed under MIT, however, this license was removed in [this commit](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/commit/7451b570037c0ea7d425ed21c33ca1ebafbb5024) leading all new changes or commits to be fully unlicensed, and therefore falling back to copyright only. Prior commits are always licensed under MIT and can be freely used of course. This entire statement regarding the license is not relevant to the nature of the copyright infringement of this takedown notice, however I would like to maintain full transparency.

To clarify, Azalea is not affiliated or legally linked with Sparx LTD, Sparx Maths, Sparx Learning, or any similar company, as stated in the README statement. The project is instead just extending their website, adding extra functionality through injecting code with a Chromium Extension.
