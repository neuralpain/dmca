**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] working for CorruptedMemes LLC, assigned the responsibility of addressing the infringements of their copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We at CorruptedMemes LLC are facing an issue with a Github repository managed by a user named "l4tt," which is hosting copyrighted graphical interfaces without authorization. These interfaces, clearly visible in the images on the repository, are proprietary to our company. Despite our repeated requests, "l4tt" has refused to remove these materials from the repository.

As a result of this refusal, we are now urging Github, the platform hosting this repository, to intervene. We believe that the continued presence of our copyrighted materials on this repository not only violates our intellectual property rights but also goes against Github's policies on copyrighted content. Therefore, we are seeking Github's assistance in taking down the repository to prevent any further unauthorized use of our copyrighted interfaces.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL.**

https://github.com/l4tt/rune-cheat-engine

This entire repository is infringing on our copyrighted proprietary software interface, which is clearly visible in their repository's readme file. We kindly request the complete removal of the repository. We will provide the link to the GitHub repository along with screenshot examples that demonstrate the unauthorized use of our UI in their readme, which they have also included in their repository code. 

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We cannot find any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**
