**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of TechSpecs, a company responsible for [private] that has been uploaded without permission on GitHub. As the [private], I have the authority to act on its behalf concerning any copyright infringements related to our proprietary software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work in question is a proprietary software codebase developed by TechSpecs for our internal and product usage. The codebase comprises both frontend and backend components of our software and contains sensitive information, including authentication credentials. The work is proprietary and not posted online for public access due to its confidential nature.

URL: https://github.com/ayushdubey7799/Learning-projects/tree/53d83b5306ee050007b43ef329822449422414be/techSpecs (Both frontend and backend)

Here's a sample link to my organization's google service account credentials that is being exposed in the above repo https://github.com/ayushdubey7799/Learning-projects/blob/53d83b5306ee050007b43ef329822449422414be/techSpecs/frontend/lib/techspecs-200811-521bba22163c.json

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have implemented several technological measures to control access to our copyrighted material:

1. Service Account Authentication: Our codebase integrates with Google Cloud Platform using Service Account authentication credentials. This system is designed to ensure that only authorized users and services can access our proprietary data and services on the Google Cloud Platform.

2. API Key Management: Our software uses unique API keys which restrict access to specific functionalities and data. Unauthorized users without these keys cannot interface with our services.

3. Source Code Repository Access Controls: On our original repository management platform, we have set up specific access controls to determine who can view, edit, and distribute the codebase. This restricts unauthorized sharing or distribution of our proprietary code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project has publicly exposed our Service Account authentication credentials, which are integral to our technological protection measures. By revealing these credentials on a public platform like GitHub, they have effectively bypassed the access controls we set in place for our Google Cloud Platform resources. Anyone with access to these credentials can potentially misuse them to access our cloud services, thereby circumventing our intended security protocols.

Moreover, by uploading our entire frontend and backend codebase, they have bypassed our source code repository's access controls. This not only exposes our proprietary algorithms and methods but also potentially provides backdoor access to any integrated systems or data that the code might interface with.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I haven't conducted a thorough search for all forks of the infringing repository. However, given the sensitivity of the data and the potential repercussions of its unauthorized distribution, I urge GitHub to consider assisting in identifying and removing any such forks containing the same infringing content.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
