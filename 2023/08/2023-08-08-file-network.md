File-Network is private software developed by me that is without permission being published on github. As software was not yet released it is likely that person submitting it has taken it from one of my colleagues who i have showned the beta version and leaked it to claim work as their own

It took us few months to notice it was being leaked as we were googling to see if similarly named software is a thing and found the exact same code and exact same data in repository but published under different name
