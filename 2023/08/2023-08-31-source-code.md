**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the original [private] of those private tools.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is a closed source piece of software that is meant to be public and especially not under an open source license due to the tool allowing for people being able to get around multiple security things on games. It was an educational project.. The individual posted the closed source intellectual property after me sharing it without permission on a MIT licensed repo. That original repo seems to be deleted by now. However there are multiple forks around already.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
