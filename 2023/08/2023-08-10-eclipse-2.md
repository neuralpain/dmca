Dear GitHub Support Team,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a serious situation that I have discovered in one of the repositories hosted on your platform.

My name is [private], I am the [private] of the company that owns the copyright to the source code contained in the repo. My repository, which contains code intended to be used on the ROBLOX platform, with a paid version has been copied and re-sold by another developer. The original public repo being https://github.com/Ethanoj1/Eclipse, which includes code to access my website and receive the copyrighted code from there. The private repo with the protected source code can be found as [private].

I'd be extremely grateful if you could look into this and take the appropriate actions to remove the repository in question. The confidentiality of my work and the integrity of my code are essential to me, and I am confident that GitHub will take proper measures to protect my rights and prevent this blatant infringement.

I greatly appreciate your attention to this situation and your quick response. I am happy to give you with any extra information you need. As the best repository hosting platform, I am optimistic that GitHub will address this issue quickly and efficiently.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work has been re-obfuscated under a different name with the same internal methods. These methods have been previously private, and were blatantly stripped from the original code, with the user even admitting to this. The user was contacted about the infringement over [private], but proceeded to ignore it. The work was taken from the company website's API, being eclipsehub.xyz, and slightly modified with a rebrand. This repository holds part of the infringing code, which is why it must be taken down. This user, vwSaraa, is now attempting to circumvent the previous GitHub DMCA takedown performed on August 2nd, 2023.

I have recently filed a similar successful takedown on this same user. However, within 3 hours of the takedown, they re-uploaded the code under a different repository with a different name.

Public Original Repo: https://github.com/Ethanoj1/Eclipse  
Private Original Source Repo: [private]  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository at https://github.com/vwSaraa/Ui.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The original source code and the infringing code are obfuscated with the same Lua obfuscator, specifically optimized for the ROBLOX platform.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project re-obfuscated the protected methods from my protected code and is selling access for monetary gain. The infringing code has been obfuscated to make it harder to detect the similarities in the methods used between my code and theirs. However, it is evident that the obfuscated code is infringing on my code.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks have been identified.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
