Dear GitHub Legal Team,

I am writing you as the [private] of gamepluto.com, to report a copyright infringement regarding the website design and content. I have discovered that another website, https://blumgi-rocket.github.io, has clone the entire website of GamePluto without permission or authorization.

The design elements and content of GamePluto's website are unique. I have invested a significant amount of time, effort, and resources into [private], and i believe that https://blumgi-rocket.github.io has unlawfully taken and used it for their own website.

Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") § 512(c), this letter serves as a formal notification of copyright infringement and a demand for immediate removal of the infringing materials hosted on your platform.

The unauthorized use of our copyrighted design and content is a violation of the law and we request that you take appropriate action to prevent further infringement.

The Original copyrighted work can be found at the following URL(s):  
https://gamepluto.com

To assist in clarifying the infringement:

Direct URL Comparisons:  
Original Site: https://gamepluto.com/  
Cloned Repository Preview: https://blumgi-rocket.github.io/  
If you review the content in gamepluto.com and blumgi-rocket.github.io homepage, you can see that the content was identical. They just changed the website name. Below is the screenshot.

I can provide similar direct comparisons for every single page if required, showing the striking resemblance, or in many cases, exact replication.

Visual Evidence: I can provide side-by-side screenshot comparisons of each page from my original website and the cloned version in the repository. This will make the similarities glaringly apparent.
 
Timestamp Evidence: Using web archival services like the [private], I can prove the originality and precedence of my content. [private]
 
Codebase Similarities: Beyond just the visual content, if you were to review the underlying source code, CSS, JavaScript functions, and even comments within the code, you'll find them to be identical or eerily similar, further evidencing the act of cloning.

I request that Github immediately remove or disable access to the infringing materials and notify the user of the Infringing Website of this notice. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. 

Sincerely,  
[private]
