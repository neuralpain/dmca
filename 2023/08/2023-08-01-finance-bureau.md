I am a [private] of the Finance Bureau in Meishan City. The website of the association was officially taken offline in 2016 and has since been cancelled. However, during the network security supervision by the higher authorities, it was discovered that the homepage source code of the association's website still exists. After careful investigation, it was found that the page is the front-end HTML code of the homepage before 2016. The account tag that uploaded the page source code is labeled as Data Mining, Nature Language Processing. Furthermore, this repository contains a large amount of front-end HTML code from different websites, indicating that it was obtained through web scraping scripts and then uploaded.
