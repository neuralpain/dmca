**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the code. I hold the copyright to the code that was copied onto GitHub without authorization

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work that was copied is [private] repository:

https://github.com/deathline94/Juicity-Installer

It is a bash script [private] to simplify the installation of a binary.

I am the [private] of the code in that repository. I hold the exclusive copyright to the source code in the repository

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following forked GitHub repositories contain my copyrighted code and should be taken down entirely:

https://github.com/3yed-61/Juicity-Installer

https://github.com/mshaterzadeh/Juicity-Installer

These forked repositories appear to have replaced my name with the fork author's names as if they created the code themselves. This is false attribution of my original work without permission.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The two forked repositories I identified are the only ones I found that improperly remove my name as author and claim the code as their own:

https://github.com/3yed-61/Juicity-Installer

https://github.com/mshaterzadeh/Juicity-Installer

These are the only two forked repositories I wish to have taken down for falsely claiming authorship of my code without permission. I am not aware of any other violating forks at this time.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

Apache-2.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

My original code in my repository at https://github.com/deathline94/Juicity-Installer contains copyright notices naming me as the author.

The forked repositories at:

https://github.com/3yed-61/Juicity-Installer

https://github.com/mshaterzadeh/Juicity-Installer

Have removed my name from the copyright notices in the code I authored. They replaced my name with their own names as if they created the code.

This violates Section 4 of the Apache 2.0 license which requires retaining the original copyright notices and attribution. False attribution of authorship also goes against the license terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Restore the original copyright notices and author names in the source code that attribtutes me as the original author.  
Add a copy of the full Apache 2.0 license text to the repositories.  
Remove any false claims of authorship or copyright ownership by the fork authors. Attribution should be given to me as the original author.  
They could also make the repositories private if they wish to limit access to the infringing content while making the above changes.

However, completely removing the infringing repositories would be the recommended path to compliance, since they have no right to redistribute my code with false attribution.

In summary, restoring proper attribution, adding the Apache license, and removing false authorship claims would be the minimum changes needed for license compliance. I would still recommend full takedown

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

I would still recommend full takedown

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
