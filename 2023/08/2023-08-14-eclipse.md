Dear GitHub Support Team,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a serious situation that I have discovered in one of the repositories hosted on your platform.

My name is [private], I am the [private] at the company that owns the copyright to the source code contained in the repo. My repository, which contains code intended to be used on the ROBLOX platform, with a paid version has been copied and deobfuscated by another developer. The original public repo being https://github.com/Ethanoj1/Eclipse, which includes code to access my website and receive the copyrighted code from there. The private repo with the protected source code can be found at [private].

I'd be extremely grateful if you could look into this and take the appropriate actions to remove the repository in question. The confidentiality of my work and the integrity of my code are essential to me, and I am confident that GitHub will take proper measures to protect my rights and prevent this blatant infringement.

I greatly appreciate your attention to this situation and your quick response. I am happy to give you with any extra information you need. As the best repository hosting platform, I am optimistic that GitHub will address this issue quickly and efficiently.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyright code has the exact same internal methods as used in this infringing code. It is evident that spies were used to obtain the source code from the obfuscation so the infringer could re-assemble the source code. At first, it seemed to just be a significant coincidence, but the infringing repository includes features and methods that only I have made, which confirms my suspicions. The work was taken from the company website's API, eclipsehub.xyz, and slightly modified with a rebrand. Since others have been referencing this repository to place in their own projects, it is crucial action is taken swiftly.
