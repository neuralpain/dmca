**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the repository "https://github.com/lazarus/soulworker-server." I have personally written and created all the code and content present in the repository.

I am the [private] of the software project related to the emulator of the SoulWorker protocol, and I have not used any copyrighted material, including server source code owned by LionGames or any other third party, in the creation of this repository.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/lazarus/soulworker-server

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice. I believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake for the following reasons:

Original Content: The content in the repository "https://github.com/lazarus/soulworker-server" was entirely original and personally written by me. It did not contain any, copyrighted or not, server source code owned by LionGames or any other third party.

Misidentification: It is possible that the takedown notice was issued based on a misidentification or misunderstanding of the content present in the repository. The repository's title or description might have caused confusion, leading to the mistaken claim of copyright infringement.

Open Source Nature: It is important to clarify that the purpose of the repository was not to infringe upon LionGames' copyrights or distribute their server source code. Instead, the project was focused on researching and understanding the SoulWorker game protocol through reverse engineering attempts. This was done without modification or inspection of the game, client, or mentioned "server source code".

While I acknowledge that reverse engineering the game protocol could be perceived as a potential concern, it is crucial to emphasize that the repository did not contain any actual copyrighted server source code from SoulWorker or any other third-party game. The code within the repository was solely dedicated to the exploration of communication mechanisms between the game client and server.

As an [private], my intention was to gain knowledge about network protocols, and I did not intend to use this knowledge to violate any intellectual property rights. The research was conducted for educational and learning purposes, and the repository's code did not result in the replication or recreation of any copyrighted assets or gameplay features present in SoulWorker.

Lack of Similarity: The repository in question involved reverse engineering attempts to understand the SoulWorker game protocol, but it did not copy, share, or replicate any, copyrighted or not, server source code owned by LionGames. The code was independently written from scratch, focused on researching communication protocols between game client and server, and did not lead to the creation of a functional SoulWorker server. While the nature of the project might raise concerns, there is no shared code between the repository and LionGames' copyrighted content.

Good Faith Counterclaim: My counter DMCA claim is made in good faith and with the belief that the removal of the repository was a mistake. I am not attempting to infringe on any copyrights or deceive in any way.

Based on the above points, I firmly believe that the removal of the repository "https://github.com/lazarus/soulworker-server" was a result of a mistake, and the repository does not violate any copyrights or intellectual property rights of LionGames or any other entity.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
