When I realized the risks in this repository。 The code was completely deleted quickly after the upload, yet unfortunately it had already been used by some other users.

The code is used based on our organization's business procedures which are related to more than 14 products operating in 31 provinces in [private] and therefore unauthorized usage of the code may cause unexpected breach of user infomation and/or business secrets that may lead to severe legal issues. Please also note that only part of the repository's files are listed above as otherwise there would be too many items to clarify the same condition.

I am trying to contact the man that fork my repository，unfortunately there is no any information I can concat him/her

This matter has brought me many risks and troubles 。 Please delete this repository ， thank you very much
