These parts of the software source code of some Yandex services became publicly available as a result of leaks from Yandex's internal repositories. See, for example, the following reports in the mass media and on Yandex's official website: https://ir.yandex/press-releases?year=2023&id=2023-01-31; https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/30/01/2023/63d7ee2e9a794727f84e437c; https://journal.tinkoff.ru/news/yandex-net/. The published fragments are indeed taken from Yandex's [private], a tool through which the company's developers work with the code.

I hereby inform you that the exclusive rights to all of the code uploaded to the abovementioned repository belong to Yandex.

In order to prevent infringement of Yandex's intellectual property rights, please terminate the use of Yandex's software (its source code) at the link https://github.com/adofsauron/dementor/tree/15aecdcfec856f1fe9f5b556c0d1cd3d0b3ebc5e/ya/docs by completely deleting this repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Posting the source code of Yandex services may further threaten the security of users and Yandex itself if parts of the code become available to criminals or hackers.
