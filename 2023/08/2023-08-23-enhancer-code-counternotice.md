Dear support,  
My repository in question has been active since February 2023, and I have been improving the code with what I learned from other authors. All the code in my repository was written by me. All other authors snippets used are covered under fair use, and the appropriate quotes are highlighted at the top of the page below the logo, i.e., "Built by @[private] Version 2.0.0 (Contributions: @[private] @[private] @[private] @[private] @[private])".  
The changes made to my code after reading the "Chaturbate Enhancer" code from the author "[private]" were only implemented on [private], in 4 commits. To avoid any issues, I removed these commits on July 21, 2023 when I received the DMCA notice. In this way, the code that was available did not have any fragments of the requestor. So there wasn't any reason to remove my repository.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
