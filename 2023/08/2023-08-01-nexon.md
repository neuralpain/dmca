GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an attorney representing Nexon US Holding Inc., which is acting on behalf of Nexon Co. Ltd and Nexon Korea Corporation in this matter (collectively "Nexon ").

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Nexon is a worldwide leader in free-to-play games. Nexon currently services more than 60 online games in more than 100 countries and since its founding, Nexon has generated more than 1.3 billion player registrations.

Nexon's games are available through Nexon's Launcher, which is available at https://www.nexon.com/main/en/download/launcher.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository is available at the link included below should be removed.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The NexonGameSecurity platform was developed by Nexon to control access to copyrighted content in Nexon's games.

The NexonGameSecurity platform controls copyrighted assets within Nexon's games and controls various functions related to Nexon's in-game currency, which is also used to obtain copyrighted assets within Nexon's games. By disabling the NexonGameSecurity platform, cheaters are free to access Nexon's copyrighted content without authorization. For example, they can manipulate their character’s stats and automate game playing to farm in-game currency, or editing game packets to exploit game server logic to duplicate copyrighted items.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing program uses a sophisticated approach involving several steps, including:

1. Creating a copy of the original game client's memory code section and passes the address of the copied code to the CRC verification function to verify it so that it can always pass the CRC verification even if the game client memory code has been manipulated.  
2. Disabling NexonAnalytics log sending by patching the return value of the [private] function to 0, so that cheaters can use a debugger on the game client.  
3. Disabling the CrashReporter by patching the return value of the [private] function to 0.  
4. Manipulating the MachineID by hooking the [private] function and generating random 64 bit values.  
5. Disabling the ThreadID verification routine.

Screen captures showing the specific memory addresses and Opcodes involved are available and can be sent via email.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
