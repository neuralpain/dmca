**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I, [private], am the rightful owner of the original copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Copyrighted work that is being infringed upon is software of mine whose leaked code and files are being distributed in described repositories.

After careful examination, I have verified that each repository is utilizing files that unequivocally belong to me. Furthermore, in two of them there have been subsequent commits made in an apparent effort to obfuscate the origin of the code.

Files may have been obtained through a data leak resulting from a security breach suffered by the company I am [private]. This breach also compromised our personal files (copyrighted work in question), including original pre-compilation software files and data.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
