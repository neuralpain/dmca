I'm a [private] of the GitHub [private] that owns the copyrighted work and I hold the [private] in [private] to the project.

https://github.com/dart-code-checker/dart-code-metrics is a plugin for the Dart analyzer that provides additional lints. Few months ago we announced the sunsetting of this version of our product and changed the license to Business Source License.

BSL does not allow creation of derivative works and modification of the license in any fork. The former is violated by new commits to the fork and the latter has been clearly violated here https://github.com/Flutterando/flutterando-metrics/commit/b12affbb36d9bed32ad4461e872c78152593cfa2. Therefore, I'm requesting to take down the whole repository https://github.com/Flutterando/flutterando-metrics.

I tried to contact them and asked nicely to stop, but got no response and they keep adding new commits to the fork.
