**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

Arclight is a bespoke piece of software, all code is original, has been written by myself and contains no code from LionGames, copyrighted or not.
I believe this DMCA to be a mistake, the initial claim states "we have recently confirmed that our development source code has been posted on Github.", this is a false statement as no part of Arclight uses code from LionGames.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
