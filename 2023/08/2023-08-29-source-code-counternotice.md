Lambda may be a confusing name for a project I might have been confused for another project.

"Zombie Escape" is a common name and gamemode among Source engine servers, this one was created as a different version, not using code from other "Zombie Escape" projects as an open source alternative. This however does use code contained in [private] which is also under the same owner as this project with the same open source license.

TF2: Custom Taunts may be similar to other known "TF2 Taunt" projects, this one was created with the aim of more freedom to control various parts and add custom content.

Note that these three projects have little to no relation to each other besides the same project owner and open source license.
