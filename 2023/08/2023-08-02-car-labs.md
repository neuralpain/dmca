I sell custom 3D models online and sell them on https://car-labs.tebex.io/. I was recently informed that a person went rogue and began leaking his whole game server on github and made it public.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://car-labs.tebex.io/category/standalone-non-escr

These are my vehicles. Person bought a few of them, however was never given permission to post them online anywhere for free.
