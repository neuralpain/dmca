**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the code that is being utilized in the repository mentioned above. The code is released under the MIT License, and I retain full ownership of the copyright for the original work. As the [private] and copyright owner, I possess the authority to take action in accordance with the terms of the license and address any violations of its provisions.

I have identified that my copyrighted code has been used in the mentioned repository without proper compliance with the MIT License terms, which require appropriate attribution and retention of the original copyright notice. I am taking this action to ensure that the license conditions are respected and that proper acknowledgment is given to the original author, as stipulated by the license.

By submitting this DMCA takedown request, I am acting within my rights as the copyright holder to address unauthorized usage of my work and to safeguard the integrity of the licensing terms.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I would like to provide a detailed explanation regarding the copyright infringement that has taken place on my original work, which has been used without permission in the repository mentioned below:  

Suspected Infringing Repository URL:  
https://github.com/Bright-Hustle/adonisjs-whatsapp

URL of the Original Source Repository (Owned by [private]):  
https://github.com/sooluh/adonisjs-whatsapp

My [private] and copyrighted work is located in the repository https://github.com/sooluh/adonisjs-whatsapp. This repository contains code that I have [private] and licensed under the MIT License. I hold full copyright over the code.

I have discovered that the repository https://github.com/Bright-Hustle/adonisjs-whatsapp contains a complete copy of my work without proper authorization or necessary notification. The owner of this repository has replaced the original owner's name in the license, the package.json file, and several other files that should have attributed me as the original creator.

This violation encompasses not only unauthorized use of the code but also alterations that change the copyright information and original attribution that should be present in the code as per the MIT License terms.

I wish to submit a DMCA takedown request to address this copyright infringement and restore the integrity of my work. I sincerely hope that this matter can be resolved in a fair and lawful manner.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files within the repository are copies of my copyrighted work. Therefore, I kindly request the removal of the entire repository at https://github.com/Bright-Hustle/adonisjs-whatsapp.

This takedown request aims to ensure the restoration of the integrity of my work in accordance with copyright and the terms of the MIT License.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have identified cases where my copyrighted code has been utilized without proper adherence to the relevant licensing terms in separate repositories. Although the individual did not fork or create new repositories, they directly copied the code from my original repository and made distinct commits. This action involved using code from the most recent changes in my repository without proper attribution or compliance with the stipulations of the MIT License.

I kindly request that these instances of code utilization be addressed to ensure alignment with the appropriate licensing conditions.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

MIT License

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The license has been violated as the individual has directly copied and utilized my copyrighted code without including the required copyright notice, attribution, and the terms of the MIT License. The original author's name, which should have been retained as per the license, has been replaced with inaccurate information. This action constitutes a violation of the license's terms, which mandate proper attribution and acknowledgment of the original work.

I have reviewed the repository in question and found multiple instances where my code is used without adhering to the license conditions. The failure to comply with these terms is evident in the absence of the proper copyright notice and the necessary acknowledgment of my work.

I kindly request that appropriate action be taken to address this violation of the licensing terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To ensure compliance with the MIT License, the following steps can be taken:

Add Attribution: Ensure that the source code includes the copyright notice and attribution as per the MIT License, including the original author's name.

Avoid Changing Owner Name: Avoid changing the owner's name in the license, especially if only making changes to the code and not creating a separate repository with a different name.

Retain License Information: Do not remove the existing license information from the code.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the project remains in line with the terms of the MIT License and respects copyright and proper attribution.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
