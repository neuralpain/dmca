**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

As a representative of Alrovi ApS, the creators and copyright holders of the RoGold extension, I am authorized to act on the company's behalf in matters related to the protection of our intellectual property.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

RoGold is a proprietary software developed and copyrighted by Alrovi ApS. The software offers specific features to its users through our platform. The original work can be found at https://www.rogold.live/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository found at https://github.com/TWINPEAKS-S/RoGoldPatcher contains infringed content and should be removed. Furthermore, the specific branch at https://github.com/TWINPEAKS-S/RoGoldPatcher/tree/css includes our copyright disclaimer within the CSS files.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have technological measures in place, including authentication mechanisms and encryption, to control access to our copyrighted content.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project has been deliberately designed to bypass our authentication process. It provides unauthorized access to our proprietary CSS files by ripping them from a paid subscription and hosting them separately, along with giving access to the rest of our program. This essentially nullifies the subscription model we have in place.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

All forks within the network serve an identical purpose, allowing for copyright infringement in a consistent manner. This remains true for future forks as well. The current members of the network (https://github.com/TWINPEAKS-S/RoGoldPatcher/network/members), as of the time of writing, include the following URLs: https://github.com/CheckYourMate/RoGoldPatcher, https://github.com/CheckYourMateyy/RoGoldPatcher, https://github.com/KH0DIN/RoGoldPatcher, and https://github.com/SODHASUDHGASJD/RoGoldPatcher.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
