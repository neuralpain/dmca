Dear Sir/Madam,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am contacting you as part of the [private] of Goodnotes Limited, a software company which provides digital note-taking services. We recently launched a new product behind a paywall. However, on Thursday, around 9pm August 10, 2023 [private], a Goodnotes employee reported an exploit that was shared in [private] (Chinese social media) and Github (a publicly accessible code repository). The code here allows an individual to jailbreak the premium version of our app without having to pay.

This code belongs to us, it has been stolen from us and posted on to GitHub maliciously. This post infringes our rights to the code and has led to users using our app without properly obtaining a licence. This leak has caused a massive impact on our company’s earnings, so this matter is urgent. Therefore, we request immediate removal of the post as this is a clear breach of GitHub’s Content Removal Policies.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorised by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
