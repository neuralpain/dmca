I am the [private] of https://github.com/chatgptjs/chatgpt.js . Shortly after my initial commit, @mefengl offered to commit some basic functions, and I accepted him as team member. As I built the library to be robust, he began copying the code but attributing using the MIT license.

However, he does no such thing for my code in: https://github.com/mefengl/chatgpt-infinite/blob/main/LICENSE

He also makes no attribution in the source code on here or [private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Other Change
