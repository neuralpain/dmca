https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/16.0/droggol_theme_common/  

these modules are having Odoo Proprietary License v1.0 (OPL-1).

The [invalid] Github user published our modules that are having Odoo Proprietary License v1.0(OPL-1).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our apps need to be purchased from the Odoo app store and then the buyer can not put them publicly like this.
