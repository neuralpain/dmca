While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

I am the [private] and [private] of the Keyboard & Mouse for xCloud browser extension.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The work in question is the "Keyboard & Mouse for Xbox xCloud" browser extension, which I developed and released on my own. The extension is distributed through the Chrome, Edge, and Firefox web stores and allows users to add additional features to Xbox game streaming services (mainly control of games using keyboard and mouse).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repositories at: (1) https://github.com/PiSaucer/xcloud-keyboard-mouse-free (2) [invalid]

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The extension includes paid features which are enforced via a software licensing and payment system known as ExtensionPay (https://extensionpay.com). Without payment, a user can try the product for 3 days via a free trial, but after that they must pay for a license or the software will stop working. This system effectively controls access to the software functionality.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Both repositories exist for the sole purpose of distributing modified versions of the copyrighted extension to remove/bypass these payment enforcement features and are in clear violation of the DMCA.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
