No

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

MIT

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

This repo https://github.com/mefengl/chatgpt-tampermonkey-starter relies on a library defined in https://github.com/mefengl/chatgpt-tampermonkey-starter/blob/main/packages/chatgpt/src/index.ts which is open source but under MIT license so requires proper attribution. In that file itself and README, he has properly included my name as copyright holder, however in the repo LICENSE.md he only credits himself (so if further derivatives of my work are created, my name is missing)

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Add proper attribution to repo LICENSE.md (preferable) or hide/remove repo

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
