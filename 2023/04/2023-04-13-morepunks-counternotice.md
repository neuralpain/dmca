**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**  
  
Dispute the notice.  
  
**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**  
  
First there's no copy - the images are all original, that is, they are all new computer-generated (pixel art) images in the tiny 24 by 24 pixel (24x24px) format by myself (that is, nothing has been copied from opensea.io/collection/morepunks - for example, an official more punks "original" punk image is 1200x1200px with gray-ish background).  
  
One way to see if there's a duplicate (of the "images referenced via "1000 More Punks" crypto (non-fungible) tokens)  
is to generate a hash digest / fingerprint (md5, sha256) from the "official" images files and than proof that there are no duplicates / no matching digests / fingerprints.  
  
Most repos in the take down request / file are awesome readmes, that is, history notes / documentation  
with images (falling under fair use¹) or programming step-by-step tutorials / guides for learning & education  
(falling under fair use¹).  
  
¹: even if the asserted / false claim of copyright would be taken into consideration.  
  
A note about the 24 by 24 pixel (24x24px) size.  
If you take a low-resolution of 300 dpi (dot - that is, pixel - per inch)  
you get a square size of for 24x24px of 0.8 inch by 0.8 inch (or 0.2cm x 0.2cm).  
  
For a high-resolution of 600 dpi you get a square size of 0.4 inch by 0.4 inch (or 0.1cm x 0.1cm).  
  
Claiming the copyright to such tiny computer-genrated images might actually be a fraud  
(if you consider that 1000 More Punks is selling token claiming "ownership" to the images or such).  
  
To add to the absurdity the "1000 More Punks" take down filer hasn't invented the 24x24px pixel head style  
and most images such as pixel zombies or pixel alien or pixel humans (male / female)  
are copies of other (pixel art) collections and if the claim holds for "1000 More Punks" to "own" 24x24 pixel orcs or demons  
than in the same way you can claim that someone "owns"  
the copyright to a pixel zombie or alien in 24x24px - and, thus, the (1000) More Punks collection needs to get taken down.  
  
To conclude:  
In the current legal public research / discussion  
it is up for debate if you can claim or protect 24x24 (8-bit) pixel art (computer-generated) images  
and claiming all rights to all pixel demons, vampires or orcs in 24x24px for all-time by simply - as in this case -  
uploading an image as an anonymous (More Punks) user.  
It is questionable and for the court (legal copyright scholars) to decide  
and even a fraud (like uploading / minting a solid color (block) to the blockchain and than claiming  
to "own" the (sole / exclusive) copyright to the color for all sizes and images etc.).  
  
Let me quote / hightlight two public legal opinions on 24x24 pixel art in the "punk" portrait head style:
