One of our GitHub projects (https://github.com/vmware-samples/packer-examples-for-vsphere) has been forked to a new project: https://github.com/sorquan/packer-vmware/. Forking is perfectly fine, but as you can see from the commits history, they have removed our license and notice files, which is not. We respectfully request that this forked project comply with the requirements of said notice and license files. After our original DMCA request, you have asked us to revise our notice to include only direct links to files or folders we with to report. Since they have removed our NOTICE and LICENSE files as can be seen here: https://github.com/sorquan/packer-vmware/commits/main, the entire folder contained at https://github.com/sorquan/packer-vmware is no longer compliant with the requirements of the project license (BSD-2) and would be considered to infringe our copyrights. Once they add back the NOTICE and LICENSE files, they will be compliant.
