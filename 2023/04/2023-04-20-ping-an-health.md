We applied for take down three projects two days ago: https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2023/04/2023-04-11-ping-an-health.md  
GitHub Trust & Safety team reminds us to pay attention to the following two projects, which fork out from the projects we applied to take down.  
https://github.com/xietalent/gateway  
https://github.com/blameswood/filegw
These two projects are identical to the projects we requested to take down earlier, so we request to take down these two projects as well.  
The reasons are as follows:  
1. The commit record of project https://github.com/blameswood/filegw is identical to that of project [invalid]  
2. The submitter of project https://github.com/xietalent/gateway is [private], who is the same person as the submitter of the project [invalid], rather than the owner of this project xietalent.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/xietalent/gateway  
https://github.com/blameswood/filegw
