I am an [private] for Mojang AB.

Minecraft is a global phenomenon with a significant and loyal fan base and community. In order to protect the integrity of Minecraft and the vitality of the Minecraft community, Mojang owns and enforces all intellectual property rights in and to Minecraft, including internationally-registered trademarks and copyrights in the game, game characters, and related consumer products based on the same. Mojang’s trademark rights include but are not limited to common law and federally-registered rights in the MINECRAFT mark (U.S. Reg. No. 4,252,394). In addition, Mojang owns registered and unregistered copyrights in connection with Minecraft, including but not limited to U.S. Copyright Reg. Nos. VA 1-885-980, VA 1-885-976, VA 1-886-104, VA 1-885-991, VA 1-885-988, VA 1-886-003, VA 1-886-007, VA 1-885-995, VA 1-886-008, VA 1-885-983, VA 1-885-978, VA 1-885-999, VA 1-886-006, VA 1-886-005 and VA 1-885-990 for artwork and character designs featured in the game (Mojang’s intellectual property rights are collectively referred to as the “Minecraft IP”). Mojang takes its intellectual property rights seriously and enforces them vigorously.

Mojang is keen to ensure that its community is treated fairly and safely, and that players and fans of Minecraft are not exploited. Mojang has therefore implemented the Minecraft EULA (https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula), which governs the use of Minecraft. The EULA prohibits, among other things, “giv[ing] copies of [Minecraft] to anyone else,” “mak[ing] commercial use of anything [Mojang] made,” and “try[ing] to make money from anything [Mojang] made.”

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Mojang is aware that there is a clone of Minecraft known as EaglerCraft which is a clone/rewrite of Minecraft the game. EaglerCraft is built on the same mechanics, use of textures, and other game systems and UX as Minecraft. EaglerCraft allows the connection to servers and does not align to the authentication schema of the authentic Minecraft game. Exact source code or pixel perfect images do not need to be in the repo to constitute copyright infringement. The development and distribution of this product infringes Mojang’s intellectual property rights and violates the Minecraft EULA. EaglerCraft also infringes Mojang’s Minecraft copyrights by using Minecraft character designs and artwork to advertise these services.

The original Minecraft can be located at http://minecraft.net.

Please note: Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-web-client

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We use Azure Active Directory sign in with license checks to prevent unauthorized access to our application. We also use industry best practices such as compiled code and encrypted sub-components to prevent unauthorized or inappropriate access to our application.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

This user has presumably decompiled and reverse engineered portions of our code to find how to recreate the game. They have leveraged several historical versions of the game as well as other common libraries which are all laid out in the credits documentation.

Their code goes against our EULA and Terms of Use by disabling and allowing unauthenticated connections to servers as well as redistribution the client for local game play

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes
