Greetings,  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
I am a [private] for The Home Depot. During a recent incident, which involved restricted and sensitive company data found published online, it was discovered that four (4) public GitHub repositories have lines of company code and data posted on GitHub by a former employee.  
As this individual is no longer employed by The Home Depot, the [private] at The Home Depot is requesting on the company's behalf (with our [private] aware and involved) that the repositories (and their data and code content) are removed from GitHub.  
Please feel free to contact me or [private] ([private]) if you have additional questions. We look forward to hearing from the GitHub team regarding the confirmation of these repositories' takedown.  
  
NEW Information as of 4/7/2023:  
I am explicitly requesting that all four (4) repositories are taken down:  
https://github.com/jgrayHDQC/ARCDEV [github.com]  
https://github.com/jgrayHDQC/Integration [github.com]  
https://github.com/jgrayHDQC/IMAGES [github.com]  
https://github.com/jgrayHDQC/componentList [github.com]  
The specific example of infringed, internal-only code that I provided resides within the https://github.com/jgrayHDQC/Integration [github.com] repository at the following url:  
https://github.com/jgrayHDQC/Integration/blob/main/HDMS_MyHDP_Retirement_LEGACY.rtf [github.com]  
  
*Should malicious actors use this public and infringed, internal-only code, they could create an email template or website which attempts to trick users into thinking that The Home Depot attempted to contact them regarding their retirement plan. This URL, as I stated in the original request, has the utmost priority for The Home Depot [private] and [private] for removal from public GitHub access.  
  
*The Home Depot [private] has opened and reviewed every single URL within these repositories. The code in each URL in all four (4) repositories belongs to The Home Depot, and it is infringing to have it made publicly available by a former employee who was not the sole creator of the code.  
  
*Should a malicious actor gain access to the code, manipulation of the code could occur to put The Home Depot at risk for enterprise-wide compromise. In addition, this code may be used by other companies or individuals who attempt to create fake portals and domains which mimic the real Home Depot, attempting to trick The Home Depot customers and other users into clicking on malicious links.  
  
*The Home Depot has not given permission to any individuals or organizations seeking to use this internal-only code, and the former employee who wrote and posted the code on GitHub should have used The Home Depot’s official [private], which requires an [private], [private], and [private] to edit and access.  
  
I have read the Copyright - DMCA Takedown Policy [docs.github.com] and the Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice [docs.github.com].  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
For GitHub, The Home Depot has its [private] that requires an [private], [private], and [private] to gain access to the [private] and urls. Upon leaving the company, a former employee should not have access or individual ownership to company data, including the former employee in question in this request.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
It is not believed this was "maliciously circumvented" by this employee. However, the current restricted and sensitive company data is publicly accessible on GitHub. The Home Depot has not given permission to any individuals or organizations seeking to use this internal-only code, and the former employee who wrote and posted the code on GitHub should have used The Home Depot’s official [private], which requires an [private], [private], and [private] to edit and access.  
  
**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
The four (4) repositories mentioned above are the only items we'd like taken down in this case. No additional forks were identified.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
No  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
  
Reported content must be removed  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
As the former employer of this individual user, we are not in a position to provide any contact or personal information of a former employee.  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
