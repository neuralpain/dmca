**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The content in question consists of a series of private code libraries, predominantly written in Python and Javascript, pertaining to deep learning utilities. Five out of the six libraries contain deep learning tools or utilities that utilize OpenAI's GPT and other company fine-tuned deep learning large language models. Library one and two allow users to scrutinize the contents of a website and execute actions on the knowledge for the user. The code parses the HTML of any page and reads in the contents into GPT. The next library is a fine-tuned model that receives a series of chat messages and generates a response that mimics the user's voice and tone to a new recipient. The fourth library is a deep learning-based code linter that aims to correctly format large blocks of code without using classical lint techniques. The fifth library is a custom integration for OpenAI's davinci model to a text editor on a local machine. The sixth library is a tool to extract the contents of a file and format it into Notion using their API.
