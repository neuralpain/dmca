I am submitting this counter-notification on behalf of Tensorfork Labs, the [private] by assignment of LLaMA-dl and its associated documentation.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The repository at [http://github.com/shawwn/llama-dl](https://github.com/shawwn/llama-dl) was taken down due to GitHub's receipt of the DMCA notice posted at https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2023/03/2023-03-21-meta.md.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The code in the LLaMA-dl repository allows users to download the weights associated with the LLaMA machine learning model. The files in LLaMA-dl themselves are not infringing of Meta's copyrights. Rather, Meta asserts a copyright interest in the weights and objects to the fact that the LLaMA-dl allows the download of the weights.

However, the facts embodied in the LLaMA-dl weights do not have sufficient originality to be copyrightable. They were copied from the works used to train LLaMA-dl by a rote automated process and do not reflect any human selection or arrangement. Per [private]

Because the weights are uncopyrightable facts, Meta does not have a copyright interest in the weights and therefore LLaMA-dl does not induce infringement of any copyrightable interest.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
