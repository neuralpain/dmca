Dear GitHub Trust & Safety :


I have read Copyright - DMCA Takedown Policy and Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice. 


I  created a blog repository [private] last year ， This blog repo was used to record my daily life and some technical thinking.   

Last week, our company's information security team contacted me and informed me that one of the articles（[private]） on my blog had leaked the company's technical secrets（about how our system implements Multi-Geo functionality）. They requested that I delete the blog post. So, I deleted the entire blog repository. However, I noticed that a user named 'david8888888888' had forked my repository, and there were still privacy contents in it. I tried to contact this user, but it seems that he has been offline all the time. 

All the content in this repository is my personal notes. If possible, I request that you help me delete this entire repository（https://github.com/david8888888888/fanlv.github.io） . If that is not possible, please at least delete this one article （https://github.com/david8888888888/fanlv.github.io/blob/master/2022/02/26/dts/index.html）.

Thank you.

The following is Github url and screenshots about my forked repository :
