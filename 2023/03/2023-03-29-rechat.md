My name is [private] and I'm the [private] of a SaaS company named Rechat.  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

We have recently hired a freelancer and after a few months he has made many of our repositories and API Authentication keys public.

While we are immediately rotating all of the secrets and authentication tokens, I urge you to remove the repositories (and their clones) that have been made public.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This repository contains our Front End code:

https://github.com/OneDev0411/Real-Estate-Website

This repository contains our Back End:

https://github.com/OneDev0411/Node-Backend

This repository is a plugin to our platform:

https://github.com/OneDev0411/real-estate-commission-app

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We had previously identified the following repository:

[invalid]

The freelancer removed the repository back then while he was still employed. Later we found another repository under different account.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
