The following repositories are forked from [private], which is our company's internal security review plan and security strategy, and belongs to confidential information. The original repository submitter is an employee who has resigned. He leaked this confidential document to Github's public repository without our permission and approval last year. We've contacted him last year to delete the repository, but he couldn't reach the people who forked his project. And we couldn't contact the owner of the following repositories as well. So we hope you help us to delete these repositories which include our confidential information.
