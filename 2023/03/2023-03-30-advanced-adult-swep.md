I am the [private] of this mod and used to sell it on the store. However, I have since stopped selling it, and I've noticed that unauthorized sharing of its contents has been occurring. I request that you remove this content. Furthermore, I believe that this mod violates your "GitHub Sexually Obscene Content" policies, as it generates destructive sexual content. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The store link is here but need Steam login authorization, because of stopped selling. I provide some link which the mods page screenshot. If you request page cache you suggested way, I can provide. Thank you for your understanding.
