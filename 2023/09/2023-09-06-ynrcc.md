- Link to [private]'s project demonstration video url connection: [private]  
[private]  

- Associated [private] network disk download url connection: [private]

From the above information, we can prove that we are the original author of the warehouse code;

The relevant certificates are as follows:

[private] The warehouse is built by our enterprise, so the ip information is the internal LAN ip.

The code warehouse can only be seen in the internal terminal of our enterprise, which contains the relevant logos of our enterprise, such as the security management software we purchased.

[private]  

You can see from the id of the author who participated in the project that we are the original author of the repository. According to our analysis of the corresponding repository authors involved in infringement, they have not made any changes to the code of the clone repository!

4.According to the relevant handling opinions of DMCA, we also give priority to trying to contact the owner of the corresponding warehouse. After receiving our email, some warehouse authors took the initiative to delete the repository they owned as soon as possible, and expressed their understanding of the reason for our request for deletion.

However, there are still many warehouse authors. We have sent many emails to communicate without any response. The following is the contact information form of the relevant warehouse we have sorted out:

Declaration: The above link address exposes our test database ip address, port, corresponding link user name and password information (test environment, currently modified), configuration center ip address, application deployment host user name, ssh port, application deployment path and other information.

The security risks are: Although we have done address changes and user modification operations at present, criminals can still find the underlying library used through the corresponding access method we use, and try to attack our application through the vulnerabilities of the corresponding library. In addition, they can analyze the deployment mode of our entire CICD to obtain the path, parameters and other information of our application deployment, which pose a threat to our production environment;

Declaration: The above link contains the organizational structure, user, account, account limit and other table structure of our bank.  
The security risks are: The leakage of these table structures, if our production environment corresponds to the database service is attacked, the criminals will easily obtain the user information of the corresponding service and modify the corresponding account and account transaction limit and other information;

Declaration: The above link contains the user name and initial password of some of our administrator users. Although we have modified the production system, the criminals can still analyze the entire authentication encryption process of our application from the composition of the password and the corresponding java code of the table, which will cause serious harm to the identity authentication function of our online application;
