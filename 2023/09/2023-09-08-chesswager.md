**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

As the original [private], [private], and [private] of ChessWager, I am the copyright owner. My name is [private], and "I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice".

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

ChessWager is an instant payout betting platform that allows users to bet on real-time pro-level chess games as they are being played on lichess.org using cryptocurrency. It is noteworthy that currently, only test funds are accepted as I haven't launched on a mainnet yet due to the legal compliance process. It can be accessed at chesswager.io. The code is hosted at https://github.com/geektechniquestudios/ChessWager.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository should be taken down, as the user aceholder001 has reuploaded the work as their own, replacing the commits that I made with the exact same message using their identity in place of mine. They also claim the work on their profile page under "top contributed repo"

The repo: https://github.com/aceholder001/chess_wager  
Their page: https://github.com/aceholder001

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The repo in question does not have any forks, and when I search I don't see anything that would suggest there are forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 3, 19 November 2007

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The user aceholder001 has reuploaded my original work, obscuring the commit history by replacing my contributions with their identity. This constitutes a misrepresentation of the original work's authorship.

The key violations in relation to the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 are:

Preservation of Appropriate Legal Notices: The AGPLv3 mandates that the original copyright, disclaimer of warranty, and preservation of other notices remain intact. By replacing the commit history, the user has effectively removed these attributions.

State Changes: If the work has been modified, AGPLv3 requires that the modified files carry prominent notices stating that they have been changed. Since the user has obscured the commit history, it is unclear if such notices have been appropriately added for any potential changes.

Moreover, they have changed the name of the repository from "ChessWager" to "chess_wager" and appear to claim the entire work as their own on their profile page (https://github.com/aceholder001). This is misleading and suggests that they are the original author, violating the spirit and terms of open source licensing by not providing appropriate credit to the original creator.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3, the following steps must be taken:

Restore Original Attribution: The user must restore the original commit history and ensure that all attributions to the original author (myself) are evident and unambiguous. They should clearly indicate the original source of the project and credit the original authors in the README or a prominent place in the repository.

Ensure Legal Notices Remain Intact: All original copyright notices, disclaimers of warranty, and other legal notices must be preserved and displayed prominently. This ensures that users of the software are aware of their rights and obligations under the AGPLv3.

State Changes: If any modifications have been made, these changes must be documented clearly with the modified files carrying prominent notices stating the specifics of the changes.

Provide Source for Network Users: If the software is run on a network server in its modified version, aceholder001 must ensure that the complete source code is made available to any user of the software, as per the requirements of AGPLv3.

However, given the extent of misrepresentation and the unethical appropriation of my work, I believe the most appropriate action would be the complete removal of the project from aceholder001's profile. This will address both the violation of the license terms and the larger ethical concern of plagiarism.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, they do not publicly post or share any contact information.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
