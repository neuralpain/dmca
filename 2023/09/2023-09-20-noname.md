**Which license?**

[*The GNU General Public License v3.0*](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (hereinafter referred to by *GPLv3*).

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

This repository https://github.com/Wenshu01/noname-qingyao is a fork of [Noname](https://github.com/libccy/noname) (but not forked by GitHub’s fork feature). 2 days ago, they removed the LICENSE file containing the content of *GPLv3* https://github.com/Wenshu01/noname-qingyao/commit/08f11388727925b9a1afd003185c8919a3163015#diff-c693279643b8cd5d248172d9c22cb7cf4ed163a3c98c8a3f69c2717edd3eacb7, which violates Section 4 (and therefore, Section 5) of TERMS AND CONDITIONS of *GPLv3*:

> 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and **give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program**.

> 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, **in the form of source code under the terms of section 4**, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

Some contributors found the violation, then asked them to revert the change of removing the LICENSE file (https://github.com/Wenshu01/noname-qingyao/issues/1) (https://github.com/Wenshu01/noname-qingyao/issues/2) (https://github.com/Wenshu01/noname-qingyao/pull/3). However, they did not respond to these requests. Instead, they updated their [README.md](https://github.com/Wenshu01/noname-qingyao/blob/aea5f83b86f12a817f666b9dfdd53a21e3707c62/README.md), saying:

> 一开始我是支持GPL协议的，但是某人的GPL精神告诉我，我加GPL变成了乐子
于是，**我在1.10.1α版本中删除了这个协议**

Roughly translated:
> I initially supported the GPL, but someone’s GPL spirit accused me of being a laughingstock for it
That’s why **I stripped the license in version 1.10.1α**

Not only did they admit that they removed the LICENSE file **on purpose**, but also looked upon *GPLv3* and the open source philosophy as dirt, which is extremely unacceptable and disgusting in the open source community around the world.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Revert the change of removing the LICENSE file.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

Revert the change of removing the LICENSE file. If they still refuse to do so, [this repository](https://github.com/Wenshu01/noname-qingyao) may be taken down.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
