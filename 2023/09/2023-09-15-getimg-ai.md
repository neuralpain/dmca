I'd like to report abuse and stolen copyrights by the owner of https://github.com/apusnetwork-official

I am the [private] and [private] of copyright of getimg.ai, and those guys have stolen the UI of our website - getimg.ai - they have not even managed to change the colors of the sliders in the left-hand side menu.

See below for a reference:  
- [private]   
- https://getimg.ai/text-to-image

The stole code is in this repository: https://github.com/apusnetwork-official/dazzleai-frontend

As the second piece of evidence, you can review the public code on https://github.com/apusnetwork-official/dazzleai-frontend, which literally shows that they have just replaced 'getimg' with '[private]'

The second problem is that they have copied our terms of service -> [private]

And they claim that business is operated by [private] (which I [private] and I can prove) while we do not have anything in common with that website, and I do not want to deal with its problems.

Please also provide me with full data of your customer, since I want to start legal proceedings.
