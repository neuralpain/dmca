Hi, this is Wellbia.com. We are making and producing the anti-cheat tool for our partners. You can check more details here: https://www.wellbia.com/index.php  
As you can check, files uploaded on the links above could be seen our code sources which must not be distributed to the publicly
Those files must be possessed between Wellbia.com and the partners whom we have contracted.  
Those codes within the files contain how to operate our anti-cheat modules so when hacking tool makers refer them, our modules could be easily detoured.

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

When we provide our modules to our partners, there is a password in each compressed module. That password only can be seen within the email.  
Also, there is a website where the partners can download our modules there. Only the one who has an account can access there

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

We can not check our partner’s project so it’s unclear

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

Yes, I found one and it's exactly the same database as I shared it to you above and all the files listed above must be removed too.
