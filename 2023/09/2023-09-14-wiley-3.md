Accordingly, Wiley requests that http://www.github.com immediately cease access to the Wiley Properties in connection with the Website, and further requests that http://www.github.com confirms in writing to the undersigned that (i) access to the Wiley Properties has been removed and that (ii) appropriate actions have been taken against the account holder under your Abuse Policy/Terms of Service Agreement.

The information in this notice is accurate and we state, under penalty of perjury, that we are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
