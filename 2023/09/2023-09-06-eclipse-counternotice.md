Hello,

My content was taken down by another developer who [private] the repository Eclipse [https://github.com/Ethanoj1/Eclipse]. He claims that I stole his source code and distributed it to my repository. In the report he filed, he marked the DMCA question "Is the work licensed under an open source license?" as false. [https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2023/08/2023-08-01-source-code.md]. I checked his license and his content is filed under GNU general public license which means there is no copyright, evidence: [https://github.com/Ethanoj1/Eclipse/commit/7f7c3a2abe9467fdfca12a2a99f22ef063566aee]

Also, the developer who filed a copyright takedown claims to have privately contacted me on the platform "[private]." I have no message history with him.

Should you require any additional information, please let me know.
