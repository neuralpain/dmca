Subject: CEASE AND DESIST – ‘Saikou App’  

Dear GitHub Inc.,  

This notice is being issued by Corsearch Inc. (“Corsearch”) on behalf of AXN Investment, Inc. (the
“Rightsholder”), the owner of exclusive rights in a vast catalogue of copyright protected anime content which is
being infringed by the platform referred to in this notice. A representative list of such content has been included
as Appendix 1 (“Infringed Content”).  

Evidence of Corsearch’s authority to act on behalf of the Rightsholder can be found in the attached enclosure
to this email.

It has come to our attention, that one of your customers, namely ‘[private]’ (URL:
[private]), has been utilizing the online services that GitHub Inc. ("GitHub”) provides
to facilitate and/or enable unauthorized access to numerous works infringing upon the exclusive rights of the
Rightsholder.  

User ‘[private]’ has been knowingly providing access to the Saikou Application (the “App”), which is
available for download from your GitHub repository at https://github.com/saikou-app/saikou. The App enables
unauthorized access to anime content, an activity that is well established as copyright infringement under
applicable laws, and relevant case law. Examples of the App facilitating infringement have been attached in
Appendix 2.

We attempted to contact the user ‘[private]’ directly regarding this issue via the email address
[private] that is listed on his [private] [private]. However, we received a bounced response
from what appears to be a non-existent email address (please see attached). It may be that user
‘[private]’ has provided an incorrect email address on his [private] [private].

The unauthorized distribution or public performance of copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement
under the Copyright Act, Title 17 U.S Code Section 106(3)-(4), and comparable laws in other countries. The
App’s conduct may also violate the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and The
Universal Copyright Convention, as well as bilateral treaties with other countries that allow for the protection of
Rightsholders' interest in copyrighted works.

In light of the foregoing, we are asking that you immediately remove the App from your Repository and disable
access to the App on your Repository in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17 of the
United States Code, Section 512(c) (“DMCA") and/or as per the GitHub Inc.'s terms of service, which prohibits
use of your facilities for copyright infringement as stated on your website: https://docs.github.com/en/sitepolicy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy.
