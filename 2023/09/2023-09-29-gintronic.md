Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 110 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of some of the fonts that are distributed via this repository.

No one else other than me has the right to distribute named fonts. Especially not for free download. There are several font families offered, but I claim the infringement about ”Gintronic”. 

The repository offers fonts for download under the MIT license. The faulty license of this repository reads:

”Copyright (c) [private]  

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: […]”

which is definitely an infringement and not according to the actual license of the ”Gintronic” fonts.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original fonts can be purchases here https://markfromberg.com/projects/gintronic and are nowhere officially posted only for reproduction. The font files in this repository are clearly pirated.  In the downloaded font files, the copyright note is embedded: ”Copyright © [private]. All rights reserved.”

Also, here is my official font distribution (commercial) website for the Gintronic font: https://markfromberg.com/projects/gintronic. That I am the [private] and copyright holder can also be seen here: https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gintronic where it is officially stated as ”Designed by [private]. From Hypertype”

Those fonts are offered in all 12 styles as OTF and TTF files each and are a webfont rip of my fonts. Font files are: 

Gintronic > OTF >   
Gintronic-Black.otf  
Gintronic-BlackItalic.otf  
Gintronic-Bold.otf  
Gintronic-BoldItalic.otf  
Gintronic-Light.otf

Gintronic-Medium.otf  
Gintronic-MediumItalic.otf  
Gintronic-Regular.otf  
Gintronic-RegularItalic.otf  
Gintronic-Thin.otf  
Gintronic-ThinItalic.otf

and  Gintronic > TTF >

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/AhmadJaber/Coding-Fonts

Entire Repo should be removed, as older versions would stick around in the commit history if only the Gintronic folder would be removed.

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Stated repo has 107 forks at the time of visiting. Hence I’d like GitHub to automatically take down all forks (as the . I have done sample inspections into several forks and those where basically just clones fo the stated one, hence containing the same copyrighted fonts that they are not allowed to distribute. 

I’d like GitHub to take down the entire fork network according to its DMCA guidelines: ” if the reported network that contains the allegedly infringing content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you state in your notice that, […]” 

In addition, if the reported network that contains the allegedly infringing content is larger than one hundred (100) repositories and thus would be difficult to review in its entirety, we may consider disabling the entire network if you state in your notice that, "Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository." Your sworn statement would apply to this statement.

One fork example is this: https://github.com/DaBultz/coding-fonts, which has even more fonts that might also not be allowed to share.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
