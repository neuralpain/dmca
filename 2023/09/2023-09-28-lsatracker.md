**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am the copyright holder.  
  
**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**  
  
No  
  
**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**  
  
GitHub  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and [private] of the code hosted on the GitHub repository in question.  
I personally developed this project from January to April 2023.  
The code is a product of my intellectual efforts, conceptualization, and execution, which was hosted under different [private] ([private]) at the request of a client, "[private]" is repository opened by client, in which I was the only [private]/[private].  
When we ended our collaboration due to client unresponsiveness.  
I only reacted to this copyright violation, after I noticed my work plagiarized under a different repository, with the false claims by individual Honest888 literally claiming ownership over my intellectual property without referencing me as the original author.  
I also have a license file in the repository that clearly illustrates the terms of use and conditions of the project's distribution.  
Original code base with original Git history resides now in [private] under my control: [private].  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
The copyrighted work in question is a PHP/Laravel based code base, which was developed to fulfill specific project requirements - search engine optimization helper tool for tracking the rank of Google Local Services ads.  
This repository includes diverse integrated functionalities and features, all explicitly designed, developed, and executed by me.  
The original code was hosted at client's [private] - [private].  
After I noticed theft of my intellectual property, I took action by deleting the codebase at [private] (which seemed abandoned) and migrating the codebase to a [private] under my supervision - [private], with the original Git history still intact.  
Final product is (was, I am not in contact with previous client) hosted here: [private]  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
The entire repository— https://github.com/honest888/Google-LSA-Ranking-Tracker-with-Vite-React-Laravel-Google- is suggested for takedown due to the extensive replication of my original work. Furthermore, specific files in this repository demonstrate explicit instances of copyright violation, especially by incorporating elements directly copied from my project.  
  
For instance, the file at https://github.com/honest888/Google-LSA-Ranking-Tracker-with-Vite-React-Laravel-Google-/blob/2ffee90977778ff05e36c5c3711a60a05d2811db/app/Services/AxiosCrawler.php#L33  
(specifically Line 33) unmistakably references [private]. [private] name "[private]" is embedded within the folder path, which is structured according to the [private] user, created by [private] for project development and usage.  
  
Notably, a side-by-side evaluation of the commit histories from my original and the infringing repositories uncovers the unlawful duplication:  
  
- My [private]'s commit history ([private]) presents a steady, organic progression of the project throughout the time frame during which the development occurred.  
  
- In stark contrast, the infringing repository's commit history (https://github.com/honest888/Google-LSA-Ranking-Tracker-with-Vite-React-Laravel-Google-/commits/main) shows a forced Git history where the entire project was uploaded in one initial commit. Subsequent commits were primarily superficial updates that included adding a Readme file, screenshots, describing the application's flow, or simply presenting my work falsely as their own.  
Additionally, the commits appear inflated with trivial changes, mainly to the Readme file— a clear attempt to misrepresent the Git history as authentic.  
To conclude this point, commits from 'Honest888' and his associates underscore their limited understanding of the system, evidenced at the following commit points:  
  
- https://github.com/honest888/Google-LSA-Ranking-Tracker-with-Vite-React-Laravel-Google-/commit/c935f277ea35ceeee56c3d682a18b6e41bb8b35c  
- https://github.com/honest888/Google-LSA-Ranking-Tracker-with-Vite-React-Laravel-Google-/commit/1eda50f97da0b8b419ecf2327109e9a7859198f6  
  
These examples cumulatively substantiate the extensive violation of my copyright on this platform.

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
No  
  
**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
I've undertaken a meticulous search for any forks of the alleged infringing repository, and I am glad to report that currently, none have been detected. Should there be any instances of my project being forked, I wouldn't perceive them as an infringement – provided, of course, that they correctly reference the source. A fork, in such a context, would be viewed as an acknowledgment of my project's value and a testament to the effort and skill that I've invested in the codebase.  
  
However, the actions taken by the user in question don't just represent a gross violation of copyright laws, but they also amount to disrespectful conduct that is deeply offensive to me. Instead of recognizing and appreciating the value of my work by creating a fork or attributing the original sources, this individual has not only exploited my work by stealing it but also besmirched my name by fabricating information about authorship. This, in my opinion, is not just copyright infringement but also a profound personal insult.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
MIT License  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The MIT License that governs the code I've developed for my [private], [private], requires that the original copyright notice (which includes the author's name) and the license itself must be included in all copies or substantial uses of the work. Furthermore, the licensee is required to credit the original author in any derivative works or uses of the code.  
  
Regrettably, an individual operating under the aliases '[private]' or 'HonestDev' and hosting the repository at https://github.com/honest888/Google-LSA-Ranking-Tracker-with-Vite-React-Laravel-Google-, has flagrantly violated these provisions of the license. My code was used and full copies of the project were published without preserving the required copyright notice and without attributing the work to me, the original author.  
  
Notably, the individual even went to the extent of falsifying authorship information, as evident in a Word document in one of the commits (https://github.com/honest888/Google-LSA-Ranking-Tracker-with-Vite-React-Laravel-Google-/blob/e886004a8768c2e92eeb3ccc3912c31b16b0e2d2/Working.docx).  
Where he wrote, I am quoting:  
  
[private]
  
This not only contradicts the license terms but also demonstrates a calculated, ill-intended violation of my rights as the original creator.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
Given the marked infringing behaviour and the extent of the violations involved, I strongly believe that simply bringing the project into compliance with the MIT license would not fully address or rectify the situation. While hypothetically, the offending individual could add correct attribution and include the MIT license in their repository, this would not negate their past plagiarism and fabrication of authorship.  
  
Considering the systematic dishonesty and intentionality with which '[private]' has acted, I don't consider it enough for him to use my code with proper attribution at this point. I instead request the entire removal of the repository in question. I believe this is the appropriate course of action given the severity of the infringement and the user's unethical behaviour.  
  
For any future uses, the individual should rightfully fork, star, or clone the original repository and adhere strictly to the license agreement, ensuring correct attribution and preservation of the license and copyright notice. Violations of this nature not only breach legal agreements, they poison the collaborative spirit of platforms like Github, thus should be addressed decisively.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
  
Reported content must be removed  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
I don't have personal contact information of the alleged infringer. However, he has made his contact information publicly available on his Github profile. Here are the provided details:  
Email: [private]  
[private]: [private]  
[private]: [private]  
[private]: [private]  
  
Additionally, I feel it's pertinent to highlight other concerning behaviors of this individual that seem to violate Github's Terms of Service. Based on my observations, the user has created multiple fake accounts, seemingly with the intention of spamming and falsely inflating repository star counts. The profiles suspected of such illegitimate activities include:  
  
https://github.com/honest888  
[private]  
[private]  
[private]  
  
More disconcertingly, this user has exploited at least one of these aliases to start discussions on my proprietary code base and staged a conversation with himself, presumably to mislead others into believing the copy-coded project is of his own origin as seen here:  
[private]  
In that discussion Honest888 (or [private]) is discussing specifics of my project:  
[private]  
, which was and is supposed to be private with one of his aliases.  
  
These actions are not only a breach of copyright but also indicative of the user's deceptive practices, trifling with Github's code of conduct and the integrity of its user community. I trust this additional information will provide more context to the situation and further enforce the necessity of addressing this infringement.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
