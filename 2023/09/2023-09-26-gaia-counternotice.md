**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

This action is by a freshly created entity outside of the US where we are established. the company that filed this notice appears to be formed by a former [private] but all of this code and content was done while they where a part of the organization and I have multiple records that can prove this is malicious takedown. They had been let go in [private] and have weaponized the DMCA process in retaliation for the failed partnership. However, the entity 0x0z, Inc. holds copyright claim and one simple look at how the code was altered in the [private] version shows you that the code began under the 0x0z, Inc. repository.

I am also that [private] of 0x0z, Inc. and a significant contributor to the codebase "[private]" and the entirety of this product was developed based on my product designs and specifications. It is unfortunate that we are at this dispute, however, my corporation is ready to prove our claim and take whatever actions are needed to clear our name. Thank you.

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
