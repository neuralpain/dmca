**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm a [private] of OpenTelecom, a small private group of software developers. We have been dealing with this individual for over a year now harassing us and stealing our work he had a previous GitHub account which he posted the same work and we submitted a DMCA around this time last year as well.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/brenden7158/encoder (and the 3 forks that it says are there), This is a program that we made in Python and it basically pulls from weather APIs and puts them in a special format that is sent out over multicast he was able to download the work and has re-uploaded it on GitHub and other sites and we keep DMCA'ing him and he doxes us and does it again its a cycle at this point.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/brenden7158/encoder, https://github.com/brenden7158/encoder/forks

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

It says there are 3 forks when I visit the forks tab I do not see any forks so I assume they are private but they are still our work so I do request they be removed we really want to limit the spread of this private program.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have any good contact information for him, All the re-uploading and doxing happens without contact.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
