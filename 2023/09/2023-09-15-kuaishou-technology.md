Hello Github Team,

 

We are Kuaishou Technology. It is nice to be able to use Github. And we now have to ask for your help and support.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Our company created a Repository called "[private]" in [private], in which the creator, content and domain name (kuaishou.com) belong to all owned by our company. And we accidentally uploaded the APK's signing certificate to the repository. The file is named "[private]", you can now see it in the fork: https://github.com/dalishen99/KwaiSDK-Demo-Android/blob/master/app/gifshow.keystore.


This is a very serious leak and we take it very seriously. The original repository was deleted as soon as we found the issue. But before we delete the original repository, there are already 5 forks.  
https://github.com/dalishen99/KwaiSDK-Demo-Android  
https://github.com/fbiciacctv222/KwaiSDK-Demo-Android  
https://github.com/Hxianlong/KwaiSDK-Demo-Android  
https://github.com/scifoshen/KwaiSDK-Demo-Android  
https://github.com/johndpope/KwaiSDK-Demo-Android  
Since these 5 forks contain the company's important source code, we hope Github can help us delete these forks ASAP. Thank you so much!
