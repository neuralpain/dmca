**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

MIT license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The original code is currently under MIT license.  
However that user has taken the code without leaving proper copyrights while telling that all 'own' modifications are under GPL license. Due to the user only putting a copied license string into each base file, not shipping a proper license notice as file and merging commits from the original project, sometimes modified without proper commit owners notices there is now way to distinct between MIT and GPL code anymore and it makes it look like the user from that other repo made it. Also just extending or modifying the original code a bit does not allow for GPL relicensing of those parts.

Besides that, the user tries to remove all names of the original project and the provided binary releases do not contain a license notice of the original project.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Preferably the repo should be removed due to the fact that this is not the users first violation of license/copyright terms.
However doing proper forking, adding copyright/license notices in proper file format, not trying to nuke all original names, separating MIT/GPL content properly (little modifications and extensions of the original project can't be GPL) in different projects/folders, and attributing merged commits properly would also do it's job

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
