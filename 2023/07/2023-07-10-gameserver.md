**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright owner of the code and project being infringed upon. As the [private] and [private] of the code, I hold the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display the copyrighted material. I have not authorized the infringing party to use, reproduce, or distribute my code in any form.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work in question is a software project titled Gameserver. This project does not have an explicit open source license; however, it is protected by copyright law. As the [private] and [private] of the project, I hold the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display the copyrighted material.

The software project Gameserver is a Node.JS REST API for a video game's multiplayer. It contains original code, algorithms, design patterns, and custom implementations that are the result of creative expression and effort. Without an open source license, the default copyright protection applies, which means that the unauthorized use, copying, distribution, or modification of the code is prohibited.

The project was originally hosted on a private [private] with the URL: [private]

Previously, a team member who had legitimate access to the codebase, specifically [private], downloaded the source code. However, subsequent to their removal from the team, they have leaked the code, leading to the infringement of my exclusive rights as the copyright owner.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository located at the following URL should be taken down:  
Repository URL: https://github.com/devvjs/gameserver

The repository contains the unauthorized publication of the original copyrighted work Gameserver. Due to the leak and infringement, I request the complete removal of the repository from GitHub.

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

I have conducted a thorough search for forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories, and I have not identified any forks associated with the infringing content. Therefore, there are no additional forks to be taken down apart from the original repository mentioned in the previous sections.
