**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My software, for which I hold / claim copyright, the mrc-converter-suite is being publicly hosted by user "amrwc" on GitHub. I do not wish my software to be duplicated or forked in a public repository such as GitHub. I have posted an Issue in the repository asking that the code be removed as a Public repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The mrc-converter-suite is software I wrote to convert various password manager's export into [private] importable formats. I provide access to this software via [private], access to the [private] link is hosted at the [private] discussion forums (link below).

[private]

This is the primary entry point to access the software, and for user security, I do not wish forked public copies available. I have no complaint if the code is in a Private GitHub repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire repository:

https://github.com/amrwc/mrc-converter-suite

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

I control the [private] link, and may remove the share, or change the link, if I deem it appropriate.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

It creates a publicly available alternate copy of the code, which is both out of date, and creates possible security vectors by being readily found via search engines.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes.

https://github.com/amrwc/mrc-converter-suite

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Yes. I have tried, via a posted Issue:

https://github.com/amrwc/mrc-converter-suite/issues/2

but there is no response. There is no email address in which to reach this user.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
