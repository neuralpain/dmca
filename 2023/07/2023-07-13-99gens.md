Subject: Cease and Desist - Unauthorized Publication of Company Code

Dear GitHub Legal Department,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a serious matter regarding the unauthorized publication of confidential company code on a public GitHub repository. As a [private] and [private] of 99GENS LLC, I kindly request your immediate assistance in removing the infringing content to prevent any further dissemination.

https://github.com/BitWiz0108/99Gens_Front-end

We have recently discovered that an individual, whose identity we are currently investigating, has posted proprietary code belonging to 99GENS LLC on a public GitHub repository. This unauthorized disclosure of our company's confidential information poses a significant threat to our intellectual property rights, trade secrets, and competitive advantage.

The repository in question can be found at the following URL: https://github.com/BitWiz0108/99Gens_Front-end. The code posted includes a very outdated build of our frontend with hard coded urls to endpoints we have now disabled from our side.

We kindly request that GitHub takes immediate action to remove the infringing content from the public repository, pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and GitHub's own policies. We believe this action is necessary to protect our intellectual property rights and prevent any further unauthorized use or distribution of our proprietary code.

Furthermore, we request that GitHub provides us with the contact information of the individual responsible for the unauthorized publication, if available, so that we may pursue appropriate legal action against them.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request that you notify us as soon as the infringing content has been removed from the public repository. If you require any further information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me at [private] or [private].

Thank you for your cooperation in resolving this urgent matter. We trust that GitHub will take the necessary steps to protect our intellectual property rights and prevent any future unauthorized disclosures.

We happily pay [private] every month for your services and we host our real code at [private]

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I have taken fair use into consideration.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.

Yours sincerely,

[private]
