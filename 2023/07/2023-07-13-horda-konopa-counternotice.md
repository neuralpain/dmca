**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am writing to submit a counter notification in response to the DMCA takedown notice regarding my repository on GitHub, which was taken down based on a falsified DMCA request. I believe that the notice was submitted in error and that I have the legal right to publish the code in question.

I want to clarify that I am an [private] and have not signed any NDA or other agreements with the individual who filed the DMCA takedown notice. Additionally, I hold the full copyright to the code in question, as it was entirely developed by me.

I am requesting the reinstatement of my repository on GitHub, as well as appropriate action against the user who submitted the falsified DMCA notice. The evidence to support my claim can be found within the commit history, and any relevant documentation within the repository.

I kindly request that GitHub reviews this counter notification and reinstates my repository within the shortest reasonable timeframe. I am willing to provide any additional information or clarification necessary to support my case.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/nullikxyz/Hordziarz

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I would like to emphasize that I am the author of the code to the extent it was published. I have not entered into any agreement with "Horda Konopa" in particular that would transfer the copyright to them. Therefore, "Horda Konopa" is not the owner of this code. I have also not entered into any agreement with "Horda Konopa" that would prohibit or limit my right to publish the code. As the author, I have the right to decide on the publication of my own code. No such agreements have been made on my behalf by my representative.

All claims forming the basis of the DMCA notice submitted by "Horda Konopa" are not true.

As an [private], I can provide confirmation of this DMCA Counter Notice from my legal representative if requested.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
