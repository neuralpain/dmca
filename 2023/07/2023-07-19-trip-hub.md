Dear GitHub Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a serious situation that I have discovered in one of the repositories hosted on your platform.

I recently became aware that an individual has leaked my project's source code on their GitHub repository without my consent or authorization. This act is a flagrant violation of my intellectual property rights and a violation of GitHub policies.

The repository in question is "trip-hub-source-code", and the URL where it is hosted is https://github.com/mvqna/trip-hub-source-code. I want to stress that I have not given this person permission to share or disseminate my code under any circumstances, which leads me to request their immediate intervention to address this situation.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could look into this matter and take the necessary steps to remove the repository in question. The confidentiality of my work and the integrity of my code are of the utmost importance to me, and I trust that GitHub will take appropriate actions to safeguard my rights and prevent future unauthorized leaks.

Attached to this email you will find compelling evidence that the repository in question contains my source code without my express consent. I urge you to conduct a thorough review of this situation and take appropriate action in accordance with your policies and terms of service.

I sincerely appreciate your attention and prompt response regarding this matter. I am available to provide any additional information or clarification you may need. I am confident that as the leading repository hosting platform, GitHub will address this issue quickly and effectively.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My repository, which contains code intended to be used on the Roblox platform, has been obfuscated without my consent. An individual has obfuscated the source code and posted it to another repository hosted on GitHub.

The original repository, of which I am the rightful owner, is located on "Trip-Hub" and has the URL https://github.com/elxocasXD/Trip-Hub. However, I have noticed that the obfuscated code has been shared in another repository at the following URL: https://github.com/mvqna/trip-hub-source-code.

I want to make it clear that I have not authorized this person to obfuscate or publish my code in any instance. Source code obfuscation violates my intellectual property rights and compromises the integrity of my work. Therefore, I strongly request your prompt intervention to address this situation.

I urge you to do a thorough investigation of this issue and take the necessary steps to remove the repository containing the obfuscated code. Because my code is confidential and part of a proprietary project, I consider it extremely important that the privacy and intellectual property associated with it be protected.

I sincerely appreciate your attention and prompt response to this matter. I am willing to provide any additional information that is required. I trust that GitHub, as a reputable platform, will take the necessary measures to safeguard my rights and prevent future intellectual property violations.

I request that the entire repository be removed. The repository is available at the following URL: https://github.com/mvqna/trip-hub-source-code. I reiterate that I have not granted any permission for the publication or dissemination of my code in this repository at any time.
