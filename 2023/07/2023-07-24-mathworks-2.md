**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] to The MathWorks, Inc. and there are mutiple GitHub repos that are providing circumvention capabilities to undo MathWorks encryption of MathWorks users' created MATLAB programs and files as detailed further below. The identified repos violate 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2) and/or 1201(b)(1).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is a DMCA circumvention notification. 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2) and/or 1201(b)(1).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository should be taken down ASAP. The URL is  
https://github.com/ash255/matlab_exe_unpack  
The user name associated with this URL is "ash255"  

FORKS: And there are 22 forks that are the same and that also need to be taken down:  
1. https://github.com/mfkiwl/matlab_exe_unpack  
2. https://github.com/66hh/matlab_exe_unpack

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The MATLAB® Compiler program allows a MATLAB user to share their original MATLAB® programs as standalone applications and web applications, protecting the user’s underlying program’s expression (intellectual property) through a compiling and encryption process - using standard AES-256 algorithm. See https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler.html

I have a good faith belief that use of the circumventing materials and the services described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. Specifically, I have a good faith belief that the materials and services identified above violate at least 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2) and/or 1201(b)(1) as to circumventing effective access controls and copyright protection measures of works protected under Title 17 of the United States Code, such access controls and protection being provided by MathWorks' MATLAB® Compiler program for user created MATLAB programs and related toolbox add-on computer programs.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The above referenced GitHub repo is providing code and decryption keys that can decrypt the underlying MATLAB® program that has been subject to the technological measures applied by the MATLAB® Compiler to control access to the user’s underlying protected work. This decryption or unscrambling made possible by the above referenced GitHub repo is unauthorized.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, We have identified at least 22 forks of the same materials, listed below.  
1. https://github.com/mfkiwl/matlab_exe_unpack  
2. https://github.com/66hh/matlab_exe_unpack

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
