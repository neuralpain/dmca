RE:  DMCA Notice of Circumvention Technology Hosted by GitHub.com   -- https://github.com/ash255/matlab_pfile_unpack

 

Dear GitHub, Inc.:

 

On behalf of The MathWorks, Inc. ("MathWorks") and pursuant to Sections 512(c)(3) and 512(d)(3) of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) and 512(d)(3)), I am writing to place you on notice of circumvention materials made available and services offered on the GitHub.com web site at the URL https://github.com/ash255/matlab_pfile_unpack .   The GitHub username associated with this URL is “ash255".

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the circumventing materials and the services described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  Specifically, I have a good faith belief that the materials and services identified above violate at least 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2) and/or 1201(b)(1) as to circumventing effective access controls and copyright protection measures of works protected under Title 17 of the United States Code, such access controls and protection being provided by MathWorks' MATLAB® computer program for user created MATLAB programs and related toolbox add-on computer programs.  In particular, the above referenced repo materials circumvent MATLAB® pcode capability, which allows a MATLAB user to obfuscate his or her MATLAB code using a MathWorks proprietary, obfuscating code format that MathWorks provides to its users via an anti-circumvention capability.   See https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pcode.html  

 

The MATLAB® pcode capability allows a MATLAB user to share their original MATLAB® code file with other users while protecting the user’s underlying code file’s expression (intellectual property) through a proprietary obfuscation process.  The above referenced GitHub repo is providing code and descrambling capabilities that can de-obfuscate the underlying MATLAB® code files that have been subject to the technological measures applied by the MATLAB® pcode capability to control access to the user’s underlying protected file.  This de-obfuscating or unscrambling made possible by the above referenced GitHub repo is unauthorized.

 

I have taken fair use into consideration. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed, including the pcode anti-circumvention capabilities referenced above.

 

FORKS.   In addition to the above referenced GitHub repo there are 34 forks of this repo, each of which continues to provide the exact same circumventing and violating capabilities and code as ash255 at the above repo.  Of the 34 forks, 30 forks are noted as “never updated,” and while 4 forks are noted as updated 4 and 5 months ago, there is no material change and all 34 forks should be taken down.  We provide the list of forks below.  See Addendum A.

 

Please act expeditiously to take down these materials, preferably no later than 5 PM Eastern Standard Time on Friday, July 21, 2023, if not sooner.  

 

If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact me at the telephone number, email address, or postal address indicated below. Thank you.

 

Sincerely,
