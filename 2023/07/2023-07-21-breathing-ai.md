---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The user [private] (he just renamed himself to [[private]]) see [private]) is publishing all the repos and code of our company breathing.ai, Inc. [private] after repeated requests to not do so as it clearly a crime for us. He did sign a confidentiality agreement and is also breaching the agreement.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

These are the repos we can so far see he published against our consent and will. They are all our companies breathing.ai, Inc.'s and breathing.ai LLC's repos and code:  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-ai-backend-api  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-ai  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-chrome-extension  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-chrome-extension-frontend  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/heart-rate-detector  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/pluse-rate-measurement-webcam  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-ai-frontend  

There might be more that went unnoticed.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Please take down all of the following repos:  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-ai-backend-api  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-ai  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-chrome-extension  
https://github.com/bugfixer0/breathing-chrome-extension-frontend

And any you see copied in his Github profile that you also see in our [private] organization. He has no right or permission to access our code, to store or share it.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes, we only grant access to developers on [private] who sign confidentiality agreements.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

By using [private]'s measures.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, we have not. We are a $8 million valued company, but I'm the only full-time product person and can only do so much. The developer threatened us to publish them if we would not pay him $1,000. So it's urgent as I do not have time and he's already published all.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

He needs to be banned from Github to be honest. It is a crime I will report to the FBI. He's a sick person, and I can show you the communication with him that will clearly show that.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
