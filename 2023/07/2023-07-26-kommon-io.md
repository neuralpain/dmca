The content of those two githubs are direct infregments of our copyrights. Furthermore, they are attempts by a single frustrated individual to harm our company as we had to let him go from our company. The individual has signed an NDA and keeps breaching the agreement, over and over, by reposing our source code on several github accounts.

We kindly ask your help to remove this content completely as well as to disable the accounts that have published this. These accounts are harmful and scammers who relentlessly publish proprietary code.
