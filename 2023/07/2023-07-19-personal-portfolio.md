GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the original work, it's my personal portfolio.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My personal portfolio was plagiarized by another developer. I've developed my personal portfolio last year and it's currently published on [private] . Here is the link of the GitHub repository as well: https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/raphaelalmeidamartins.github.io

The developer reached out to me via [private] private message asking for a permission to use my personal portfolio source code to build his own. I obviously didn't authorized, then the guy blocked me and used the source code anyway. He just copied the whole source code and just changed the information, like the picture, the texts. But everything is absolutely the same.

He even forgot the remove meta data in the package.json file. It still has "[private]" as the project name, and my domain as the homepage.

I don't have any technological measures in place to control access to my content because it's my personal portfolio and I want the code to be open for the recruiters to see, I just don't want anyone to copy and use like it was his own project. According to [private] copyright laws, it's not because a source code is open on the internet, that it's free to use.
