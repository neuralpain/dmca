Cashear is responding is a DMCA Take Down Notice received May 25, 2023, Zendesk ticket number: 2170226.

Cashear Inc. is the owner of the materials in question. Cashear Inc. (Cashear) had a working relationship with [private], back in [private] to design an application per the specifications of the current officers of Cashear. Also, said materials [private] is referring to is not being used by Cashear. Cashear terminated its working relationship with [private] after numerous attempts to contact [private] were unresponsive, and after learning that the materials do not function or work properly in any reasonable manner, and never did during testing. We did not hear from the complainant for weeks until we were served with this complaint.

We have a good faith belief that the material that was removed or disabled as a result of the Notice of Infringement as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material. I therefore request that the material be replaced and/or no longer disabled.

The complainant has provided no copyright registration information or other tangible evidence that the complainant is the copyright owner of the material in question, or whether said material is in fact copyrighted, and we have a good faith belief that said material may not be copyright protected. The allegation of copyright violation is therefore in dispute, and at present unsupported.

The complainant does not hold the copyright to the material in question, is not the designated representative of the copyright holder, and therefore lacks standing to assert that Cashear’s use of the material is a violation of any of the owner's rights.

Our use of the material is legally protected because it falls within the "fair use" provision of the copyright regulations, as defined in 17 USC 107. If the complainant disagrees that this is fair use, they are free to take up the matter with Cashear Inc directly, in the courts. You, the ISP, are under no obligation to settle this dispute, or to take any action to restrict our speech at the behest of this complainant. Furthermore, siding with the complainant in a manner that interferes with our lawful use of your facilities could constitute breach of contract on your part.
