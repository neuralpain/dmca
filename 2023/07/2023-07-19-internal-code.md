This project is an internal project of my team serving Party A. I am a participant of this project, and my [private] account is [private]. Due to my personal mistakes, mistakenly submitted to making this code warehouse and its site ([private]), I am in a few days after the release, found this error, And the privatisation of the warehouse, and delete, did not pay attention to its has been the fork, address is (https://github.com/moutainhigh/workspace-data-middle). I was unable to find a correct contact for moutainhigh, the author of the fork. Because this project involves a lot of my party a production environment server database links, clear account and password

As informed by Party A today, its code leakage working mechanism inquiredthe repository. And in my part of the above listed configuration class or the properties of sensitive data is completely exposed, the project's core modeling package (com/yqwl/datamiddle/realtime/app) fully exposed the commercial secrets of party a, to major security and commercial risk.

Therefore, as his sole outsourcing provider for this project, I was required to solve this problem by July 18, 2023.

My original address is warehouse, you can see he has not been publicly: [private], the fork warehouse is: https://github.com/moutainhigh/workspace-data-middle. If the fork repository is deleted, my private repository address needs to be deleted as well.

This project is a Flink technology project, in which the overall framework of the web back-end service is a more general "Jeecg". The project is mainly used for Party A's data processing in the field of logistics and logistics prediction services. The database is based on Mysql, and Clickhouse is used for the result layer storage of the data warehouse. This incident also occurred because the password of the online database scanned by Party A was leaked to github. As a result, my Party A found that the project was completely exposed. So as not to cause further problems, we have now switched the project to running in production and Intranet. As a result, a production external URL is not available at this time.
