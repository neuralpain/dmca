Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of SkyStats, all code used in SkyStats is my own (or a contributor) and in no way related to SkyHelper, their style was an inspiration but when used in production (on [private]) it is not an exact match. all credits are available in my README.MD file.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/SkyStats-Development/SkyStats

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I contacted the [private] of SkyHelper (the party involved with filing the DMCA in the first place) and they (and I quote exactly) said
[private]  
They ([private]) are currently in contact with Github (via a ticket or like wise) to find out who created this DMCA falsely using their brand name as they were obviously not authorized to act apon [private] behalf.

the content showcased at https://skyhelper.altpapier.dev/ does not match my content's code, colouring or formatting!

Cheers,
