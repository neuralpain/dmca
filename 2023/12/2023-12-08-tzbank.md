I am an employee of Hangzhou Leimon Data Technology Co., Ltd., and I am submitting a request to take down infringing code on behalf of the company. Bank Of Taizhou Co., Ltd. [https://www.tzbank.com/] is our partner, and the content of the project repository for this application is all software projects developed by our company for Bank Of Taizhou.

The user [private] is a former employee of our company. When they submitted the myCode code, they were new to the industry and did not realize that GitHub is a world-class open-source platform. They mistakenly thought that they could back up the code online after submission. We contacted them in August and have notified them to delete the code and realize their mistake. However, the repository has already been forked by another user P79N6A, and we are unable to contact the person involved.
