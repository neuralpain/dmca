As an employee of CREST it is my responsibility to ensure Exam content is kept confidential and secure.

The entire repo is designed to collate and distribute CREST’s copyrighted content which includes 225 leaked Question from a CREST exam. This exam is available gloablly at Pearson Vue test centres and the content posted not only infringes copyright but devalues the exam. The previous source repo was taken down by GitHub without issue.
