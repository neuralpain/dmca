I, [private], [private] at EC-Council International Limited (“EC-Council”), am the duly authorized representative of the copyright holder of the content that is being hosted on your servers without permission.

EC-Council owns the trademark, "C|PENT (Certified Penetration Testing Professional)" and owns the copyright over the course and has full authority to report infringement containing the trademark and copyrighted materials that are identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademarks of EC-Council.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Several links that your website is hosting are infringing on at least one (1) if not more copyrights(s) owned by EC-Council. The examination questions sourced from various examinations of EC-Council official courses like “EC-Council Certified Penetration Testing (CPENT)”, is being unlawfully sold in the form of “Exam Write-up PDF” through your website without permission and in blatant violation of our proprietary rights. Furthermore, EC-Council is the owner and developer of the course “Certified Penetration Testing Professional” and owns copyright in all its versions which Kaizen Security has illegally uploaded through its GitHub Account. The customers seeking EC-Council’s courses may be misled into thinking that the infringing content and courses uploaded are endorsed or affiliated with EC-Council. As a result of the misrepresentation caused by the account owner, EC-Council is likely to suffer damage in the form of loss of sales, damage to its reputation, and further risks confusing our clients. We assert that this is a clear intent of riding freely on the goodwill of EC-Council.
