[private] repository: https://github.com/Punit9464/Avon is basically based on my public bot over [private] named AVON.  
my bot is basically a versatile music bot with the most unique features over [private] and obviously i dont want its codes to be provided publically because it will ruin the hardwork and the interest of mine from working for my bot and maintaining it.  
Its codes has been posted online by someone which infringe my ownership over my codes.  
package.json is the same and the Repository owner has provided the compiled code of the codes that i have coded over typescript.  
I don't want to publicise my codes of my public bot AVON: [private]
I have been working over these codes since too long and ruining my hardwork this way isn't fare to me.  
Kindly Please takedown the repository: https://github.com/ItzYourHacker/Oras- as it includes the codes by me.  
You may also check [private] repo's codes: https://github.com/Punit9464/Avon for the reference. Just the difference is that ItzYourHacker has uploaded the compiled up code with some editing over package.json, rest all of the code is the same.
I am certain that you will help me out for sure.
hoping for a positive reply as soon as possible.
