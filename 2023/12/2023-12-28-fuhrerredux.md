Context to Situation - They were separated from the FX (Fuhrerredux) team following a series of disagreements over adherence to multiple guidelines. This division transpired over several months, signifying that it was not an abrupt occurrence. Subsequently, they initiated what they referred to as an "insurgency" and produced a new modification utilizing our code in its entirety, without providing any attribution. Moreover, they appropriated four unreleased trees for four specific tags, published them as their own, and presented them as original creations. However, it was easy to find out the truth behind this, by examining our publicly accessible GitHub repository.
In a "troubling" turn of events, they resorted to fabricating discord messages, attempting to portray us as engaging in inappropriate behavior (being paedophiles and nazis). Additionally, they engaged in disruptive activities, such as raiding various servers, including the [private], [private] and and [private] servers, where they baselessly accused us of inappropriate conduct. Their actions extended to misleading influencers into believing these baseless allegations. Furthermore, they conducted raids on servers using alternate accounts, which we had banned for posting inappropriate content on our servers beforehand. We were unaware that these accounts were their alternate. Notably, they also shared graphic content that was child pornography. These activities persisted until they faced consequences.
During this tumultuous period, they formed a partnership with an unreleased mod called [private]. We were able to persuade [private] to terminate this partnership, after addressing their concerns about our team's reputation. In response, their team, specifically their owner, resorted to making false claims of inappropriate behavior against [private] as well. One of their [private], who had prior experience with [private], knew that these accusations were unfounded and took it upon themselves to rectify the situation. Although this [private] was subsequently removed from their team, he apologized to our team and rectified the damage caused by these false claims.
Both the [private] and the [private] expressed remorse to us, as well as to [private], and made public statements to that effect. However, a few days later, a developer who had separated from [private] copied [private] unpublished code and incorporated it into the mod that falsely accused us of inappropriate conduct, naming it "Blue Dusk." This led to significant tensions within the [private] team, resulting in a considerable amount of drama. The [private] of Blue Dusk even claimed the [private] of the insurgent mod to be contemplating self-harm due to concerns for their safety, although it became evident that this threat was not carried out, as they continued to communicate on various servers. The response from the other [private] involved was rather uneventful.
We believed the drama had subsided to a certain extent until recently, when our mod was either subjected to a DMCA takedown or mass reporting. The specifics remain unclear, but we suspect it was a DMCA takedown, as the swiftness of the action was unusual. Approximately ten minutes after we noticed our mod's takedown, they began inquiring about it in their server, making them the prime suspects at the time. Within a few hours, they also initiated a DMCA takedown on "[private]" further aggravating the situation. It is apparent that they may not fully comprehend the legal implications of a DMCA takedown, including the potential for perjury charges, as they appear to be primarily seeking attention and causing disruption. The following day, they pursued another DMCA takedown against "[private]," a mod with which our [private] team had maintained positive relations. Throughout these events, they continuously harassed all mod teams involved and even engaged in stalking of individual team members. It is noteworthy that they previously acknowledged the falseness of their claims before resuming their disruptive activities.
