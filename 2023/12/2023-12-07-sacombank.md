Dear GitHub team,

Group-IB has found specific code elements that are bringing security risks to Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Sacombank). Your servers are hosting unauthorized files that have information from the bank.

https://github.com/vishnuraju/sacombank/tree/master

Description: 

This page contains the source code of the website https://www.esacombank.com.vn/sacomweb/ that belongs to Sacombank.

This file is exposed to the public. If someone with malicious intent against Sacombank were to come across this code repository, this could be a security threat to Sacombank.

Group-IB Digital Risk Protection is an authorized representative of Sacombank. 

We would appreciate it if you could review this case and remove the repository from Github. It is not owned by the user.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you for your cooperation.
