We have software ([private]) that was developed in-house and me uploaded it to GitHub and made it public.Aware of this problem, the first time I deleted the content, but anothers has a copy. It contains a lot of private information. For example, the screen_win.py or screen.py configuration file under the path /页面截图/ contains personal private database configuration information (address, account, password). 

For example：

the 点位量.py file contains the account of the email, the Lines 11 through 13 contain the name, the email account password. the Lines 49 through 76 contain Service network address of the company.

the  邮件发送.py file contains the account of the email, the Lines 8 through 10 contain the name, the email account password.

the screen_win.py file contains the account of the email, the line 86 contain the name, the email account password; the line 17 contain the Database address account and password;
