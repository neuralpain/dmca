**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are writing in the name and on behalf of Realityshare, a cybersecurity company located in [private].
The respository contains unauthorized use of our internal code base.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is intended to serve as a pentesting framework for companies who wish to evaluate their internal security. The codebase is a part of a larger branch of our internal software.

The developer of the application is not in possession of any type of license for the transmission of our codebase, which is private, therefore this application is considered illegal.

So we ask for the repository to be removed.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology if you are unsure.**

No. We do have a system that requires a user to have a liscence for signed builds.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. The repository created is a fork of an original leak of our software.
