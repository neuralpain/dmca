**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My name is [private], I'm the [private] of Igara Studio S.A., a business based on [private]. We're the [private] of Aseprite ( https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite ), a source-available software with an EULA ( https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/EULA.txt ) that gives the chance of users to compile/build the software for their personal use but doesn't allow to redistribute the binaries.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Compiled versions of Aseprite can be found:

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We didn't search for all forks, but we have an influx of PRs trying to upload the binary as an artifact after the action is finished:  [private]

Just today we received this new PR ( [private] ) where a complete release was created.
In some way it would be nice to limit this.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The reported content must be removed, but in some way we'll still continue to receive these PRs. We'll try to limit PRs that modify the build.yml file or any GitHub action file.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, we don't.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
