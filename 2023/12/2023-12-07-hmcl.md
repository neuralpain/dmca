**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I'm authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf, whose ID is [private]. HMCL, a open source project on GitHub, required every fork NOT to remove its copyright declaration displayed in the softward. (From https://github.com/huanghongxun/HMCL/?tab=readme-ov-file#additional-terms-under-gplv3-section-7)  
However, another Project, whose name is FoldCraftLauncher on https://github.com/FCL-Team/FoldCraftLauncher, forked HMCL and removed all the copyright declaration displayed on the top of every source code file, that breaks the copyright license.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
