**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of an online game VIM-Adventures (https://vim-adventures.com). Everything on that site is [private] creation and copyrighted to me and my company.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I [private] a website https://vim-adventures.com that I [private] and [private]. It's a paid for game. Someone paid for a license, and then uploaded to github all the minimized html, css, javascript files, graphics and data responses from the server for free. Even in the README he said that he doesn't own the copyright, that it's mine. The repository was created to serve my copyrighted material. The repository contains all that was stolen and replicates [private] work without paying for a license. I submitted a DCMA request in the past (see https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/11d5d726167b4378f755cea82a00f23f4c259df1/2020/11/2020-11-12-VIMAdventures.md) and recently (https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/70c10e767a19acdc17fb213361f2dfb12a61d2fa/2023/10/2023-10-23-vim-advertures.md#L4) but there are a few more repositories found with my content.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The more advanced levels are only sent to the user after paying. A user paid for the license, copied the levels and created a server that serves them without paying.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repo is a reversed engineered server to mimic my server and avoid paying.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes I have. Currently these repositories don't have any forks, but it can change daily :/

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The original infringer was Ryan Wattrus who removed the repository by my request. The other forks are now popping online and should be deleted.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
