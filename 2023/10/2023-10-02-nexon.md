Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

I am an attorney representing Nexon US Holding Inc., which is acting on behalf of Nexon Co. Ltd and Nexon Korea Corporation in this matter (collectively "Nexon ").

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The NexonGameSecurity platform was developed by Nexon to control access to copyrighted content in Nexon's games.

The NexonGameSecurity platform controls copyrighted assets within Nexon's games and controls various functions related to Nexon's in-game currency, which is also used to obtain copyrighted assets within Nexon's games. By disabling the NexonGameSecurity platform, cheaters are free to access Nexon's copyrighted content without authorization. For example, they can manipulate their character’s stats and automate game playing to farm in-game currency, or editing game packets to exploit game server logic to duplicate copyrighted items.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

MooplePacketEditor works by being injected into the game client and monitoring the packets by hooking the game's packet sending function.

The overall functioning is as follows.

1. Inject itself to the Maplestory.exe using a separate injector  
2. Create a thread that runs the hooking code  
3. Hook the game client's packet transmission code  
4. Game Packet Monitoring

The program hooks the code in the function related to packet transmission and redirects it to the packet monitoring code.

The specific commands utilized are available and can be sent as an attachment upon request.

Users gain access to copyrighted content in the game by editing the packets.  This program is specifically designed to bypass Nexon Game Security, and the acronym NGS appears throughout the code.  For example Line 72 of the file identified below states: [private].

Again, this analysis demonstrates that MooplePacketEditor (a clear reference to MapleStory) is designed and intended to circumvent security measures implemented by NxA to protect its copyrighted content.  Nexon renews its request that this repository be expeditiously removed.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Nexon does not have contact information for the infringer.
