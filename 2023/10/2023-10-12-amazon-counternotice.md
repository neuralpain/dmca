Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The Array Subsets repository contains multiple files including descriptions, sample data inputs, and original code relating to a problem that appeared in an online sample test for an [private] administered via [private]. The original online system graded the problem incorrectly, so I used this repository to explain the actual solution, along with data inputs and tests. I do not claim any ownership of the problem description (lines 8-111 in README.md), sample input 3 /inputs/input003.txt, and sample input 5 /inputs/input005.txt; these are all copied from the [private] via [private]. The testing header file /tests/catch.hpp is copyrighted by [private] and distributed under the [private]. To my knowledge, all other content in the repository is original.

Amazon's takedown notice is flawed in either one or two ways:  
1. Removal of the entire repository: As noted above, a majority of the files are completely original. I suspect that if Amazon does have any legal claim, than it would only be to the problem description in the README and the two sample inputs mentioned above, not the entire repository like their notice implied.  
2. Possible lack of ownership: Amazon stated they are the sole owner of the test questions, and provided some evidence to support this claim (redacted when posted on GitHub so not visible or verifiable by me). However, this seems to directly contradict the fact that I was exposed to this question as part of an [private] administered via [private]. Additionally, a user on LeetCode posted the same question in 2019 under the title "[private]" ([private]). Also, VMware's logo appears on HackerRank's homepage under companies that use their product. Additionally, a cursory search for "Amazon hackerrank" online suggests that HackerRank has been used as part of Amazon's [private] process in the past. Because this question is presented by multiple companies via HackerRank, It is possible that this question is part of HackerRank's library offered to customers, and not the sole property of Amazon.

I am disputing the notice because I have not seen evidence that Amazon is the sole copyright holder of the problem description and two sample inputs. If this is incorrect and they do have a right to those elements, I would like to modify the repository to remove the offending content and preserve my own intellectual work.
