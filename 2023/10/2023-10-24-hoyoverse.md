Hello, This is COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. We are here to report infringing repositories on Github.  
1、https://github.com/luzhichun/enterprise_wechat  
Without our authorization, the links identified herein contain and display openly the codes/source codes of our game and product package, which has constituted a copyright infringement as well as a violation of the Terms of Service of the game. We confirm the entire repo is infringing. For instance,  
the previous infringing repository ([private]) has been removed under your assistance, but the infringing repository was uploaded in the currently reported infringing repositories (hk4e as the same code!); see here https://github.com/luzhichun/enterprise_wechat/tree/master/src/main/java/com/mihoyo/hk4e  
We think the above contents of the repos are copied from our game, which violates our term of service.  
**Please take down the whole repositories to stop the infringement.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No we have not.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No we don't have it.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
