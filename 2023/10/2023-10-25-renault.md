We would like to ask you to remove all the repositories with radio code calculators for radios mounted in Renault cars.

The algorithms are proprietary and our intention was never to publish it.

The algorithms are used in online tools in authorized dealerships to generate radio unlocking codes.

The radio codes protects the radio players from being used when stolen.

One needs a original sticker to unlock it or a service from an authorized Renault dealership.

The algorithm has been stolen from our IT department and now it roams on sites like GitHub.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
