**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of an online game VIM-Adventures (https://vim-adventures.com). Everything on that site is [private] creation and copyrighted to [private] and [private] company.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I [private] a website https://vim-adventures.com that [private] programmed and created. It's a paid for game. Someone paid for a license, and then uploaded to github all the minimized html, css, javascript files, graphics and data responses from the server for free. Even in the README he said that he doesn't own the copyright, that it's [private]. The repository was created to serve [private] copyrighted material. The repository contains all that was stolen and replicates [private] work without paying for a license. [private] submitted a DCMA request in the past (see https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/11d5d726167b4378f755cea82a00f23f4c259df1/2020/11/2020-11-12-VIMAdventures.md) but now it started to pop up again.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[private]

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The more advanced levels are only sent to the user after paying. A user paid for the license, copied the levels and created a server that serves them without paying.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repo is a reversed engineered server to mimic [private] server and avoid paying.
