**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have implemented several technological measures to control access to our copyrighted material in 'Prestige Client.' These measures include:

Security Features: Our software 'Prestige Client' is designed with built-in security features that restrict access to authorized users only. These features include user authentication, access control lists, and encryption to safeguard the copyrighted material from unauthorized access or distribution.

Terms of Service: Users are required to agree to our Terms of Service when using 'Prestige Client.' These terms explicitly state that the software is proprietary and may not be distributed or shared without our consent. Users who violate these terms are subject to legal action.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project, located at 'https://github.com/WalmartSolutions/Prestige' has taken deliberate actions to circumvent our technological protection measures:

Removal of Security Measures: The project has removed the security features that were originally built into 'Prestige Client.' These security measures were designed to control access and ensure that only authorized users could use the software. By removing them, the accused project has effectively opened up unauthorized access to our copyrighted material.

Violation of Terms of Service: The project blatantly violates our Terms of Service, which explicitly prohibit the distribution or use of 'Prestige Client' without proper authorization. The accused project's presence on GitHub is a clear violation of these terms.

Unauthorized Cracking: It appears that the accused project has engaged in unauthorized cracking or reverse engineering of 'Prestige Client.' This action is a deliberate attempt to bypass our technological protection measures and gain access to the copyrighted material without authorization.

In summary, the accused project has taken multiple actions to circumvent our technological protection measures, including the removal of security features, violation of our Terms of Service, and unauthorized cracking of 'Prestige Client.'
