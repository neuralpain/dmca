This user https://github.com/leonmax0623

Stole the code of my project for the websites 1001guide.net; cityplanet.org; excursopedia.com
and made it publicly available. https://github.com/leonmax0623/1001Guide-Next.js-Laravel-Backend https://github.com/leonmax0623/1001Guide-Next.js-Laravel-Frontend

1) Most likely, the theft occurred from another developer's profile [private] (the
projects are not in public, I do not have any claims to [private]).  
And the second developer: [private]  
I communicated with [private] regarding this project and ordered programming services related to it. Link
to the paid deal on [private] Screenshot of the deal:

[private]

Under the terms of the intermediary website [private], the code is the property of the client, and the
contractor did not have the right to publish it in public access. BUT! The contractor made a
mistake, I contacted him today and asked to remove the projects from public access – he did so.

2) The 1st and original code for the website 1001guide.net was ordered by me in 2020 and was
created by another developer, at that time without the use of GIT technologies. Screenshots of
my email correspondence with the developer in 2020:

Additionally, here is the technical specification file that I wrote for the developer in 2019 

[private]

3) The source code for this project and its modifications is stored in my [private] (created 3
years ago):

[private]

[private]

Additionally, a modified version, separately for frontend and backend of the project:  
[private]  
[private]  

4) In addition to stealing the code, the design, which I also commissioned from a freelancer, was stolen.
If it necessary, I will provide details about the design order.

Request: The user leonmax0623, who stole the code, does not have contact details on [private], so
I can't reach out and ask him to remove the stolen project from his profile. I also tried to find the
thief's contacts on Google – but there is nothing. 

Therefore, I ask you to delete the two projects in the thief's profile:  
https://github.com/leonmax0623/1001Guide-Next.js-Laravel-Frontend  
https://github.com/leonmax0623/1001Guide-Next.js-Laravel-Backend

I'm sending this request from the email registered on my [private], [private]. If necessary, I
can duplicate the request from the corporate email of [private].

Best Regards,
