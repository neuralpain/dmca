I am the [private] and [private] of Vacation Rental Partners Inc. (d/b/a "Direct" and formerly "Vaystays"), and I am the [private] of the "[private]" [private] account ([private]), which, more importantly related to this report, contains the "[private]" repo:

[private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our private "[private]" repo is our largest repo for our SaaS web application called Direct (www.directsoftware.com), which provides asset management, booking, back-office, and distribution tools for short-term vacation rental management and RV rental management companies that list on booking sites like Airbnb, VRBO, and RVshare (our integrated channel partners).

We are dealing with a disgruntled former [private] who we caught using a fraudulent identity (SSN/W9 and driver's license) on 9/18/2023, which was intended to be his first day as a full-time [private] after approximately two months of [private]. He was terminated with access to all systems revoked on that same day (9/18/2023). He did, however, have a copy of the [private] code repository on his local machine, which he confirmed he had destroyed all copies of in both an official declaration and the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement ("CIIIA") termination certification he signed on 9/21/2023 (copies in [private] link below).

Since then, the individual, who identifies as [private], has been attempting to hold us ransom for payment of money he is not owed and threatened (via text messages to me) to post the [private] repo publicly if we do not pay him, which, if we were to comply, would provide us with no guarantee he would actually destroy copies of our proprietary codebase, considering he already declared he did (and lied). We have been working with our legal counsel, and after the individual "invited" me to the cloned repo on Github, it is now confirmed he has, in fact, made the repo public (https://github.com/connorcasner/versailles/), which is stealing our trade secrets and against the law, which we are taking action on.

Here is a folder containing a letter from our legal counsel to the individual (https://github.com/connorcasner) prior to him making the repo public, along with the declarations he executed confirming he had deleted our proprietary codebase and would not distribute it.
