No one is authorized to exhibit, reproduce, transmit, or otherwise distribute Wiley Properties in this manner without the express written permission of Wiley, and the unauthorized distribution of Wiley Properties constitutes copyright infringement. This conduct may also violate the laws of other countries, international law, and/or treaty obligations.

Accordingly, Wiley requests that http://www.github.com immediately cease access to the Wiley Properties in connection with the Website, and further requests that http://www.github.com confirms in writing to the undersigned that (i) access to the Wiley Properties has been removed and that (ii) appropriate actions have been taken against the account holder under your Abuse Policy/Terms of Service Agreement.
