I authored and established the private repositories in question while also developing their corresponding content. Previously, I held [private] of the GitHub organization Cashear and served as the sole contributor responsible for implementing a prototype for a project in the music industry. The code remains unlicensed, and the contents have always resided within private repositories, inaccessible to the public. Recently, my [private] rights were revoked by the user [private] without prior notification or consent, and subsequently, a corporate entity known as Cashear, Inc. was established by the user [private] in April 2023 (following the commits made in the mentioned repositories) with the intend of appropriating my intellectual property.

Please note that as the author of the code contained within those repositories, I have not entered into any contracts, agreements, or received any compensation from Cashear, Inc. or the user [private]. Furthermore, they have neither sought nor obtained my permission to utilize my code for any future purposes under the corporate identity of Cashear, Inc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The following repositories are in violation:

Although I created these repositories and designated them as private, my rights to remove or retain full control over the content have been usurped without consent. It is important to note that at the time of my contributions and the initial establishment of the GitHub organization, there was no preexisting corporation known as Cashear, Inc., and no agreement was ever reached with said corporation and its members regarding the utilization of my intellectual property.
