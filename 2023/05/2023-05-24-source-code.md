This repository was working great. My developer had GitHub account ownership on the repo, and I had admin access. Once the development was completed, I asked that it be transferred to me. They transferred it, but not to me, instead, to the wrong person. I've reached out to this new repo owner many times and only heard back the first time, since then I have not heard anything (last time I heard from them was April 7th). I want this repo deleted as it's in the hands of the wrong people, and they are NOT co-operating to get it transferred back.
