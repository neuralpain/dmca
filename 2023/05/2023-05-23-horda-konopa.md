**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm [private] of one of the biggest discord servers in [private] (Horda Konopa, counting 140k+ members), where I am authorized by the owner to file this types of complains.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am writing to bring to your attention a critical matter concerning a former contractor who has violated the terms of our agreement by publishing code that belongs to Horda Konopa, as outlined in the repository found at https://github.com/nullox55555/Hordziarz. The code in question was intended exclusively for the use of Horda Konopa and its community, with strict restrictions on any form of publication.

As a result of this breach, we are faced with significant concerns regarding both the intellectual property rights of Horda Konopa and the potential security risks posed by the public exposure of our proprietary codebase. I would like to highlight two specific areas of concern that require immediate attention:

Identification of Exploits: With the codebase now accessible to external parties, we are apprehensive about the possibility of experienced individuals finding and exploiting vulnerabilities within the system. The unrestricted scrutiny of our code increases the likelihood of identifying weaknesses that could be maliciously leveraged for unauthorized access or disruptive actions.

Security Implications and Unfair Advantages: The release of our code also raises serious security concerns, as unauthorized parties now have the opportunity to analyze it in detail, potentially discovering methods to gain an unfair advantage over other users or even causing irreversible damage to our systems. This jeopardizes the integrity of our operations and undermines the trust and fairness we strive to maintain within our community.

Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you require any additional information or if you have any suggestions regarding the steps we should take to address this issue promptly.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.
