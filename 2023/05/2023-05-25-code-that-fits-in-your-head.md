**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The GitHub repository https://github.com/deinman/restaurant is my code. Most source code files explicitly include my copyright assertion, and the LICENCE file even explicitly states:

> The licence explicitly does not grant you the right to redistribute this code base to anyone else.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

As bonus content for [private] book [Code That Fits in Your Head](https://informit.com/seemann) published November 15, 2021 by Addison-Wesley I offer a Git repository with sample code. This repository is only intended for readers who buy the book. It's offered as a .zip file that readers can download.

When unpacked, it's a full, stand-alone Git repository. There's no configured *remote* repository.

Most source code files include the following header:  

[private]

In addition, there's a LICENCE file with the following content:

[private]  
>
> This licence grants you the right to read and interact with the code for personal, educational use.  
> The licence explicitly does not grant you the right to redistribute this code base to anyone else.  
> Please contact [private] ([private]) to discuss terms for a licence to redistribute.

I have tried to contact the owner by adding an issue in the repository, but recently to no effect: https://github.com/deinman/restaurant/issues/1

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repostory https://github.com/deinman/restaurant should be taken down or made private, since it's a bit-for-bit copy of my copyrighted work, with only one commit of change.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

It doesn't look as though any forks exist.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

https://github.com/deinman

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
