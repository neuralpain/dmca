This code is the backend and front end code for our application that is in production and has over 100,000 users. We fired a developer who was under a non disclosure agreement which has now been breached after the above leaked data. It is in our belief that the developer in question has modified the code to be harmful to users who intend to use the code.

Everysingle line of our application code is on those two repos, this is a serious breach of copyright and trademark infringement, I have referenced one of the trademarks infringed at the top of this email.

We have reached out to the developer to take down the code but have just been met with more threats.
