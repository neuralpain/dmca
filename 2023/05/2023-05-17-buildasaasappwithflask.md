**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Hi, I am the [private] of the https://buildasaasappwithflask.com course. My [private] on that page matches what's on [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The source code being shared on your platform is through a paid course available at https://buildasaasappwithflask.com. A sample of that project is available on https://github.com/nickjj/build-a-saas-app-with-flask.

However, this person I'm submitting a claim against took the full paid version of my course and made it open source.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Their entire repo at https://github.com/varun-singh-01/flask-saas should be removed. It contains paid content with explicit instructions in the course not to publish this code. The FAQ on https://buildasaasappwithflask.com also requests not to publish the code online in the way this person has.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes I tried searching for as much as I could.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Nope I don't.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
