**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

While we cannot definitively establish the intentions or motivations behind the unauthorized cloning and subsequent distribution of our copyrighted material, it appears that the initial incident was accidental and unintentional. Our former employee inadvertently cloned the repository containing our copyrighted source code to their personal GitHub account, and due to an oversight, the repository was mistakenly changed to a public setting.

The unintended exposure of our copyrighted material allowed it to be cloned by an unknown account. We believe this subsequent cloning by the unknown account was likely a result of the repository being publicly accessible at the time.

It is important to note that our company takes the protection of our copyrighted material seriously, and we have since taken appropriate measures to rectify the situation. We have addressed the accidental exposure by promptly issuing takedown requests to the involved accounts and have implemented additional safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future.

While the initial accidental cloning and subsequent cloning by the unknown account may not have been intentional acts of circumventing our technological protection measures, the unauthorized distribution and replication of our copyrighted material remain violations of our intellectual property rights. We appreciate your attention to this matter and request that appropriate actions be taken to remove and cease the dissemination of our copyrighted material.
