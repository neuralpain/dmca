**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am writing on behalf of OpenSynergy GmbH and Inc, as [private]. OpenSynergy’s protected business is software programming services, including software design, development etc. OpenSynergy is the exclusive owner of the infringed software, which OpenSynergy acquired from iAnywhere Solutions, Inc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Blue SDK source code and its previous versions belong to OpenSynergy. The source code of Blue SDK, including the code labelled as iAnywhere Blue SDK in aforesaid GitHub profiles, has never been licensed by OpenSynergy to be publicly available.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

We are aware of several source-code breaches happened at our business partners along the last 15 years. In the last 2-3 years we have performed other DMCA take-down requests to GitHub for the source-code of Blue SDK by my colleague [private], and our requests have been approved.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have been using automated tools for Software Composition Analysis that notified us about the specific copyrighted file. It seems that no other repositories contain our copyrighted source-code.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
