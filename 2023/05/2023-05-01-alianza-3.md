Dear Sir, Madam,  
  
Nagravision SA (hereinafter "NAGRA") is a provider of secure solutions to protect content of the media and entertainment industry (please visit https://dtv.nagra.com) and represents and is an authorized agent of Alianza contra Piratería de Televisión Paga (hereinafter "Alianza", see http://www.alianza.tv/es/) and the members of Alianza, and writes on their behalf.  
  
Alianza is a group of content providers, pay-tv broadcasters and technology providers aiming at combatting set-top-box piracy and IPTV piracy throughout Latin America. Alianza members such as CDF, DirecTV, Discovery, ESPN, Fox, Globosat, HBO, LaLiga, Sky, Telecine, Turner, Win Sports are the holders of trademarks, copyrights and other related rights including, without limitation, the right to distribute the following channels and content (the "Protected Content").  
  
Alianza and Alianza members duly authorize NAGRA to act on their behalf to conduct all activities to protect and enforce their copyrights and trademarks, whether registered or unregistered, associated with their channels and content but not limited to the following:  
  
a.) Monitoring of the Web, pirate forums, major App stores and social media platforms (and other online distribution platforms) to find applications used to illegally distribute its Channels.  
  
b.) Monitoring data sharing platforms to find so-called "playlists" that contain links that can be used to illegally access Alianza Members content and or channels.  
  
c.) Sending takedown notices and letters to remove the infringing applications and playlists from such websites, pirate forums, app stores and social media platforms and data sharing platforms (and other online distribution platforms).  
  
NAGRA has evidence that the following URLs are infringing Alianza members' rights by enabling users to illegally access the Channels, including the copyrighted materials therein.  
  
https://gist.github.com/Morcy/f9f73717927e1032d267/raw  
  
The sole purpose of these URLs is to grant unauthorized access to one or more of the Channels.  
  
We hereby request that you immediately remove, disable access, or block access to the above-mentioned unauthorized and infringing URLs.  
  
This letter is an official notification under the principles of the Berne Convention ("BC"), Article 8 in the WIPO Copyright Treaty ("WTC"), Article 14 in The Electronic Commerce Directive ("ECD") and Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").  
  
By giving this notice and referring to the principles in the above mentioned legislations we seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers.  
The purpose of this letter is to request that you immediately notify the infringer, your client, of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.  
  
Please also be advised that the ECD & DMCA requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under the laws of the United States and The European Union law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material, this immunity is lost. Therefore, you must investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.  
  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of a right that is allegedly infringed.  
  
Please confirm within two business days of receipt of this letter that you have complied with the foregoing request.  
  
Nothing in this notification shall serve as a waiver of any rights or remedies of Alianza and its members with respect to the alleged infringement, all of which are expressly reserved.  
  
We remain at your disposal for any query and thank you in advance for your cooperation in resolving this matter in a cooperative manner for the benefit of Alianza members' and the entire media and entertainment industry.  
  
Regards,
