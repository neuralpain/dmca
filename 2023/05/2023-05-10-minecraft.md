**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] for Microsoft. My scope of enforcement is for Minecraft within Mojang AB

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Please note, this repo owner goes out of their way to say they do not include decompiled Minecraft source. The about section of the repo clearly says this is providing Minecraft 1.9.4 in the browser. The files in this browser allow a person to run Minecraft without authentication or requiring a valid license.

Minecraft is a global phenomenon with a significant and loyal fan base and community. In order to protect the integrity of Minecraft and the vitality of the Minecraft community, Mojang owns and enforces all intellectual property rights in and to Minecraft, including internationally-registered trademarks and copyrights in the game, game characters, and related consumer products based on the same. Mojang’s trademark rights include but are not limited to common law and federally-registered rights in the MINECRAFT mark (U.S. Reg. No. 4,252,394). In addition, Mojang owns registered and unregistered copyrights in connection with Minecraft, including but not limited to U.S. Copyright Reg. Nos. VA 1-885-980, VA 1-885-976, VA 1-886-104, VA 1-885-991, VA 1-885-988, VA 1-886-003, VA 1-886-007, VA 1-885-995, VA 1-886-008, VA 1-885-983, VA 1-885-978, VA 1-885-999, VA 1-886-006, VA 1-886-005 and VA 1-885-990 for artwork and character designs featured in the game (Mojang’s intellectual property rights are collectively referred to as the “Minecraft IP”). Mojang takes its intellectual property rights seriously and enforces them vigorously.

Mojang is keen to ensure that its community is treated fairly and safely, and that players and fans of Minecraft are not exploited. Mojang has therefore implemented the Minecraft EULA (https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula), which governs the use of Minecraft. The EULA prohibits, among other things, “giv[ing] copies of [Minecraft] to anyone else,” “mak[ing] commercial use of anything [Mojang] made,” and “try[ing] to make money from anything [Mojang] made.”

Description of Infringing Content:  
Mojang is aware that there is a clone of Minecraft known as EaglerCraft which is a clone/rewrite of Minecraft the game. EaglerCraft is built on the same mechanics, use of textures, and other game systems and UX as Minecraft. EaglerCraft allows the connection to servers and does not align to the authentication schema of the authentic Minecraft game. Exact source code or pixel perfect images do not need to be in the repo to constitute copyright infringement. The development and distribution of this product infringes Mojang’s intellectual property rights and violates the Minecraft EULA. EaglerCraft also infringes Mojang’s Minecraft copyrights by using Minecraft character designs and artwork to advertise these services.

The original Minecraft can be located at http://minecraft.net.
