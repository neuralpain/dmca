"""Thanks for your follow-up. We understand from your counter notice that your project was not copied from the "EaglerCraft" project, as stated in the notice. Our review indicates, however, that the rationale of the notice may still apply due to the fact that your project similarly appears to be a clone/rewrite of Minecraft. If you dispute the other facts described in the notice (aside from the fact that you did not use EaglerCraft), you may submit a new counter notice with your reasoning for us to reconsider."""

prismarine-web-client is a from scratch implementation of a voxel client, that is compatible with minecraft.  
No code from mojang is used. The protocol of the minecraft game is not under copyright.

prismarine-web-client is not used commercially in any way.

It is not even used to play a game. https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-web-client  
is a GUI demo for the library mineflayer helping people explore how to make bots for the minecraft game.

This repository does not contain any asset under copyright by mojang.

This is not redistributing the minecraft client as it does not contain any code from mojang.

The PrismarineJS organization has been promoting the minecraft game to thousands of players for more than 10 years. It would be great if prismarine-web-client could be reinstated in GitHub.
