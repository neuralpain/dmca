Dear GitHub Team,

 

I am an employee of Country Garden Group. Recently, I found that our company's code has been leaked on GitHub. Our company is extremely concerned that the code may be used by malicious actors. Therefore, we hope that GitHub can take down these codes through the DMCA takedown process.

 

The following links are involved in the infringement:

Link 1: [invalid]

Link 2: https://github.com/JieGou/parking_cad  (forked from [invalid])

 

The following evidence proves that this project belongs to our company:

1. The project code contains our company's internal information, internal domain name, internal IP, and company information. The relevant screenshots are as follows:

2. The project's commits information obviously includes our company's information and employee information. The screenshot information is as follows:

3. [private] is our company's internal code hosting system. It cannot be accessed from external networks, but our company's internal network can access it. The screenshots of internal network access are as follows:

Our company is the original author and owner of this project, and we did not upload the code to GitHub. Therefore, the upload of these codes is an act of infringement. We hope that GitHub can take down these codes as soon as possible to avoid causing unnecessary losses to our company's interests.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
