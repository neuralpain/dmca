**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am writing on behalf of Ridgewood Global Limited regarding a serious matter that requires your immediate attention.

We had employed the services of a developer,[private], to assist us in creating a software application with API connections to our Amazon Seller Central account. Prior to the commencement of work, we had him sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), wherein it was explicitly stated that all materials and coding created as part of this project would remain the proprietary information of Ridgewood Global Limited.

Regrettably, [private] has violated the terms of this agreement by publishing the code, which is the intellectual property of Ridgewood Global Limited, on his personal Github account without our permission. Upon discovering this, we requested him to remove the code, but instead of complying, he has attempted to extort us by demanding funds in exchange for taking down the material. (https://github.com/sweetdream34310/Amazon_Pricing/tree/main)

Moreover, [private] has also acted irresponsibly by posting our Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Login with Amazon (LWA) credentials publicly online. This conduct is not just unprofessional, but it also jeopardised the security of our accounts and our business as a whole. (https://github.com/sweetdream34310/Amazon_Pricing/blob/main/backend/.env)

We consider these actions to be a breach of the NDA and an infringement of our copyrights. Given the severity of this issue, we kindly request you to take immediate action and remove all the referenced content from the concerned platform. This is of utmost importance to safeguard our proprietary information and to protect the security of our accounts.

We sincerely appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further information or clarification regarding this urgent situation.
