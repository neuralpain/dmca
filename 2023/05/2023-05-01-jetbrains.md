**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an employee of the copyright owner

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work is the website by the address https://jetbrains.com. I mean the website itself, not only some downloadable files, but all the content at the website.

The person this claim is against created a copy of the official website with confusingly similar address and content: https://jetbrains.com.xy2401.com/

The copy is well searchable via Google, and confuses people. The copy is outdated, and it increases harm for JetBrains' users, the JetBrains brand, and overall confusion.

The website located at www.jetbrains.com is the exclusive and authentic platform for disseminating information regarding JetBrains and its product line. The contents of the website are safeguarded by copyright, as delineated in https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/company/useterms/.

Redistribution of the website content is expressly proscribed. Creation of a website bearing semblance to the original, employing a confusingly similar domain name, amounts to blatant copyright infringement and is deemed unacceptable.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/xy2401/local-site-201912-jetbrains.com

I confirm that the entire repository is infringing upon the original work. Please remove the repository completely. The website https://jetbrains.com.xy2401.com/ is hosted on GitHub, and the content of this repository is the content of the website.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
