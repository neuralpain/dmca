Softonomika LLC is the exclusive rights holder of all products that are distributed under the Amasty trademark via the official website https://amasty.com/ or Adobe Magento marketplace https://marketplace.magento.com/partner/Amasty. I am acting as [private] of Softonomika Limited.

All projects listed below contain Amasty products that are distributed under https://amasty.com/terms-and-conditions.html. The presence of the code in listed public repositories violates chapter 14 of an agreement between the client and Amasty (Softonomica LLC) https://amasty.com/terms-and-conditions.html as the purchase of the license doesn't give to the client the right to distribute it. Shared code is a property of Amasty (Softonomica LLC) and should be removed from publicly available git repositories.
