**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We have taken down several repos. The following item is a page hosted based on those repos. The browser based game EaglerCraft is a clone/decompiled variation of Minecraft.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

Not applicable to github.io I do not think. If there are specific actions/process to use on web page content on .io that is different than a repo please advise.

No

Reported content must be removed

No
