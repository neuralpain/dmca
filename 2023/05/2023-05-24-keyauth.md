**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] of the authentication service https://keyauth.cc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

I employ encryption and obfuscation and hash checks to prevent attackers from compromising the integrity of my software.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

This repository bypasses my protection measures, hence the name "keyauth bypass", allowing people to pirate my customers' software with ease. This is violation of the anti-circumvention clause within the DMCA and I request removal.
