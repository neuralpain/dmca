I am the sole copyright holder of the work, named Logic.ly.

Logic.ly is software for Windows and macOS intended for simulating digital logic gates. The website is here: https://logic.ly

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Users must purchase a product key to unlock the Logic.ly software. If a user has not purchased a product key, they are not authorized to use the software.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repository contains the source code for a keygen (product key generator), which would allow the creating of many unauthorized product keys.

There is a comment in the source code, "Recreated from Logicly code." I confirm that the code following that comment could only have been writte by decompiling the Logic.ly software, which is not authorized.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?
