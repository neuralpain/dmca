Hello, This is COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. We are here to report an infringing repository on Github.

1、https://github.com/m4urlclo0/SR-Assets

Without our authorization, the link identified herein contains and displays openly the art materials and other works decoded from our game package, which has constituted a copyright infringement as well as a violation of the Terms of Service of the game.

We confirm the entire repo is infringing. For instance, the “readme” part is entirely our game characters’ images.

Please find below a list of files that copied our codes:

1、All files under https://github.com/m4urlclo0/SR-Assets/tree/main/Characters

2、All files under https://github.com/m4urlclo0/SR-Assets/tree/main/Monsters
