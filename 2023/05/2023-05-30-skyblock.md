My repository https://github.com/MrFast-js/SkyblockFeatures had multiple files and exact code stolen from it without including the license and put the impression that it was all original code, The offender is https://github.com/Armandukx/ArmandukxSB This repository also has multiple other repositories code for example from [private] but I'm not doing anything on their behalf.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
This is my hypixel skyblock Minecraft mod that I have been developing for the past year. I see this repository pop up that's using my code without any mention of my license or credit to the other mod makers he stole from or me. I have spent hundreds of hours coding original code and for it to be stolen like this is terrible especially since the hypixel skyblock modding scene is very competitive I can't have this person stealing my features and code saying it's theirs and then take the people who would be using my mod from me. He has quite obviously stolen the code in some instances of my Minecraft username in the code from spots I used to debug that they never removed as well as the licenses I included for modified files he kept with my name in them. My original code is here https://github.com/MrFast-js/SkyblockFeatures thee stolen code is https://github.com/Armandukx/ArmandukxSB/tree/main throughout all of their files
