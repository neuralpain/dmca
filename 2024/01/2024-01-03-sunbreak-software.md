**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original repository is listed here: [private]. It was a [private] at one point, and I have decided to make it [private] as I no longer want others to be able to see the code. The content has always had the statement in it "This code is copyright 2021 Sunbreak Software, LLC".

There is a fork, or a duplicate of my repository here: https://github.com/baudm/FitbitJsonConverter. I would like this repository to be deleted. I have attempted to contact the individual "baudm" on [private] to ask first, but they haven't responded to my message yet.

Yes, the fork in question is this: https://github.com/baudm/FitbitJsonConverter  
I have not been able to find any others.

Reported content must be removed
