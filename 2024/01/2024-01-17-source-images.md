In [private], [private] created high resolution images used for a video game modification. This is my work, created from scratch, with additional content given to me by another artist ([private]) with permission, and released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License on the website [private]

The textures are combined into a compressed binary format that is read by a video game emulator, and includes a copy of the license along side with the files (directory in question [private] which can be found in 1964_GEPD_Edition.zip\1964\plugin\cache\). This is free content released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License for users to enjoy and display.

I had discovered that my work has been redistributed, and used to create derivatives on this repo here https://github.com/GhostlyDark/GE007-HD, which is not permitted by the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License. The only place I have been credited for is in the directory path, which does not credit the other artist ([private]) that has contributed to the work. It also removes the license that I released my work under.

As seen here, my files (left) are being used by the repo (right). [private]

I have tried methods to contact the uploader, however I have no means to reach them to get an answer as their profile has no contact information, and the repo in question has issued locked. I have not been contacted by the uploader GhostlyDark, not have I given them permission to use my work for creating derivatives texture packs. As far as I know, neither has the other artist ([private]) been contacted by GhostlyDark and given them permission.
