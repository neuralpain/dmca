Dear GitHub Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [private], mostly known as [private], and I am the [private] of a software application that enhances gaming experiences. I am writing to bring to your attention a serious matter regarding the unauthorized distribution of [private] software on your platform.

I have recently discovered that [private] proprietary software, Hash Client, has been cracked and published on GitHub without [private] consent. The repository in question can be found at https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/Hash. This act directly violates the terms of service for my program, as well as infringes upon the copyright and integrity of the software.

Additionally, the contents of the repository include false information about [private] software. It is misleadingly presented as a "cheat" for games, whereas, in reality, it is a legitimate gaming assistant designed to enhance the overall user experience without compromising the integrity of the gaming environment.

In addition to the copyright infringement concerns and potential security risks associated with the cracked version, the repository's misrepresentation of [private] software could mislead users and harm the reputation of Hash.

I kindly request that you take immediate action to disable and remove the mentioned repository. The unauthorized distribution of [private] software not only undermines the principles of fair use but also poses a substantial threat to the integrity, security, and reputation of the application.

I would like to highlight the specific violations of GitHub's Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) that this repository entails:

1. Unauthorized distribution of proprietary software without the owner's consent.

2. Manipulation and cracking of the software, compromising its integrity.

3. Violation of copyright by distributing the software without proper authorization.

4. Misleading information about the software's purpose, presenting it as a cheat for games.

I have attached evidence of [private] ownership and the original terms of service for your reference. Additionally you can check [private] private [private] such as [private] [private] [private]

Please understand the urgency of this matter, and I appreciate your prompt attention to this request. If you require any additional information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me at [private] or [private].

I appreciate your cooperation in resolving this matter swiftly.

Sincerely,

[private]  

[private] of Hash
