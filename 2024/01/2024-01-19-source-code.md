Hello Dear Github:  
I am [private] (my Github acccount name is [private]).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I created my repository called [private] in 2018, the URL of my Github is:  
[private]

Before I deleted my repository [private], [private] forked whole repository.
I reported a notice for your team that "[private]" forked my whole repository (notice No.[private]) and your team have helped me with disabling the repository([private] : [private]). Thanks a lot!

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Through the previous email, you mentioned that there are two other forked repositories. I confirm that I have investigated each individual case and that I sworn statements apply to each identified fork.

The URL of those forked repositories is:  
[private]

The following are pittillo/RHMS Bugmemx/RHMS and URLs about the forked repositories:  
(i) https://github.com/pittillo/RHMS;  
(ii) https://github.com/Bugmemx/RHMS

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The list of those forked repositories is:  
[private]  
I confirm that I have investigated each individual case and that I sworn statements apply to each identified fork.

“pittillo/RHMS” and “Bugmemx/RHMS”, the entire repository is copied from from “[private]”, which also means they forked the entire repository from my “[private]”. Through URLs, it can be seen that the most recent modification record was "[private], 6 years ago", which means that after forking the entire folder, they did not make any changes and there was no new content.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No
