**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We have proprietary data that are set up into 2 separate databases: Member AR Database and Debtor Database. Our website, www.cannabizcredit.com is built by Squarespace and we use Memberspace.com to protect certain pages where those 2 databases live. The links are now under hidden pages since someone was able to bypass the protected pages using a google extension called behind the overlay. And they used JSON to rip the databases we have on those pages and post on [private].

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://revoltingblob.github.io/nameandshame/index.html

this page links to both databases stolen from our site illegally. Debtor database and Member AR database.

https://revoltingblob.github.io/nameandshame/index2.html  
https://revoltingblob.github.io/nameandshame/index3.html

All these pages should be taken down due to IP infringement.

The github links were posted in this [private] thread and the author admits: "this information is available elsewhere for a fee, but in reality the curator leaves it unsecured in plain text. unfair to people who are paying for the service in my opinion, and needs to be fixed"
