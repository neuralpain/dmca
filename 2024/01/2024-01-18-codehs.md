All items contained in [https://bfu4.github.io/codehs/ correspond](https://bfu4.github.io/codehs/correspond) to the lessons in the CodeHS AP Computer Science A course. Here is a link to the course modules: https://codehs.com/course/5657/explore?lang=en - when you click on a lesson title, you'll see the names of the exercises contained within. Please note how the names of the exercises (orange pencil icons) match exactly with the names of the files in this repo (e.g., 1.2.5 Welcome Program...all the way through 10.3 Recursive Sorting)

Each page is merely the solution to our proprietary academic content - not original work - and this is in violation of our Terms of Use. Additionally, teachers are reporting that students are using to cheat, which undermines academic integrity for students learning computer science.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://bfu4.github.io/codehs/

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content?

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, as this is a Github Pages site

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. I attempted to contact the site owner using the provided contact email address [[private]]. However, the response I received alleges that the responder is not in control of this site, and that their original code has been copied and is being used by another party.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
