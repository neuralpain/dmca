RE:  Notice of Copyright Infringement (Southern New Hampshire University)

Dear Website Administrator:

I am writing on behalf of Southern New Hampshire University to identify copyright infringement concerns regarding the website(s) identified below. Specifically, we have determined that these web sites are offering for sale live test items currently used by Southern New Hampshire University in connection with our College for Online and Continuing Education. These exams, and the individual test items that comprise them, are not only protected by copyright law, but their public exposure by the infringing web sites jeopardizes the security and integrity of our exam(s). 

Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), I have provided relevant information regarding the infringing sites and infringed content below.  I am authorized to act on behalf of Southern New Hampshire University with respect to these matters.

These exclusive rights are being violated by material available upon your site at the following URL(s):

https://github.com/coolguy555/5.13-Program-Drawing-a-half-arrow-Python-3-/blob/master/5.13%20Program_Drawing%20a%20half%20arrow%20Python%203.py

Infringing Materials/Web Site - The infringing materials all are found on github.com, which upon information and belief, we understand to be registered and hosted by your organization and located at github.com.

This site offers for sale what Southern New Hampshire University believes to be verbatim, content identical, technically indistinguishable, or substantially similar copies of the copyrighted exams listed above, commercially available for downloading by site visitors for a fee.  These web sites are in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Southern New Hampshire University, nor have these sites secured written permission or authority to post Southern New Hampshire University’s copyrighted works.  The materials posted on the site are therefore unauthorized, illegal reproductions of Southern New Hampshire University’s copyrighted exams.

Southern New Hampshire University has formed a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above is not authorized by the copyright owners, their agents, or the law.  Southern New Hampshire University further believes that such use is not covered by any form of Fair Use, since the use is unquestionably commercial, and the amount of content being infringed is well beyond any reasonable fair use.  I declare, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of Southern New Hampshire University, the owner of the copyrights at issue.

Considering the above-described unlawful and infringing content, Southern New Hampshire University requests the immediate removal of the copyrighted material from these sites, as well as the removal of all information on the web sites referring or relating to such material.  We also caution you that you have an obligation to ensure that this same infringing content is not simply re-posted on a new URL by the same individual(s) in an attempt to circumvent your initial, take down.  Southern New Hampshire University will be monitoring to make sure such action does not take place.   

Southern New Hampshire University appreciates your prompt attention to this serious matter. If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact me at [private].

Sincerely,
[private]
