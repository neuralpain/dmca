I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. In 2022 we contracted a [private] [[private]] from [private] to help with native app and React website development. We use [private] for all our repositories and no [private] ([private]) is supposed to have anything on GitHub. The [private] was fired in late 2022 as we suspected that the [private] was not doing all his own work as per our company requirements. Then on 12.25.2023 we received an email addressed from [private], but claiming to be someone else and threatening that we must pay them or they will make all our source code public on GitHub. Here is entire email string of the threats-
