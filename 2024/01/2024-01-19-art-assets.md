Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

You can only access my art content if you have purchased the product from the Roll20 Marketplace. If you have paid access to my content you can download the art assets files as a zipped collection. You have a personal use license to use my artwork if legally obtained via purchase or subscription. Reuploading those same assets to another public resource is NOT licensed.
