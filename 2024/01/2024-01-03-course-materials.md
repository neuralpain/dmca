The infringing content includes all five pieces of coursework under UoMLearning/COMP61021 Representation Learning/

4.    Regarding Forks: I have investigated and analyzed the forks of the repository and believe that the following forks are also infringing:

5.    I confirm that my sworn statements apply to each identified fork stated above. Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.

6.    Remedy for Infringement: To remedy the infringement, the affected user, GitHub username: qiletian666, would have to remove all COMP61021 course materials from their repository. Also, the same action has to taken for all the identified forks mentioned in 3) and 4).
