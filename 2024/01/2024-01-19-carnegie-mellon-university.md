CMU CS Academy is a curriculum provided by Carnegie Mellon University. The copyrighted work in this case is the starter code of our programming exercises. We provide Python programming exercises with starter code that students edit in order to complete the exercise.

The repositories that we are reporting have posted their solutions to our exercises. Their solutions are mostly exact copies of our starter code, not original work. For example, the file https://github.com/Psycho461/-APCSP-CSAcademyANSWERS/blob/main/2.4%20Honey%20jar.py has 44 lines of code. 41 of those lines are exact copies of Carnegie Mellon University's material.
