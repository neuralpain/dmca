Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 111 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

We are the copyright owner of the game Genshin Impact; see https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

As the copyright owner of the game, the codes of our game package are protected. Our website is https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/,  
https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/114066.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository https://github.com/MAnggiarMustofa/GI-Download-Library/tree/main should be taken down.  
The repository contains and displays openly the codes and pictures of our game package, which has constituted as a copyright infringement as well as a violation of the Terms of Service of the game. In its readme (https://github.com/MAnggiarMustofa/GI-Download-Library/blob/main/README.md), you may clearly find that it provides "Genshin and Yuanshen Download Links".

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork"> Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository. https://github.com/MAnggiarMustofa/GI-Download-Library/network/members
