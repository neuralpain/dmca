https://github.com/QiuChenlyOpenSource/InjectLib

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have employed industry-standard systems to restrict functionality of our MacUpdater to legitimate paying customers which includes issuing license-codes to all customers.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The project's sole purpose is using the functionality of paid apps (including our MacUpdater) without actually having to pay for them. In the case of our MacUpdater, they spoof license codes, e-mail addresses and MAC addresses to convince our server backend that they have a legitimate paid copy of our app installed. Furthermore they disable all built-in protection measures which include license-verification, build-verification and anti-tampering mechanisms.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
