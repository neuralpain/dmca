Hey there! The DMCA notice states that the tool was not open source, which is wrong. The Tool/Plugin was released as a open-source tool and is still open-source. It doesn't violates epic's EULA as the files are built over EOS Subsystem and are highly modified. The EOS Plugin was used as a base and was heavily built over.

As per Unreal's EULA 3 iii (c),

“Engine Tools” means the (i) editors and other tools included in the Engine Code; (ii) any code and modules in either the Developer or Editor folders, including in object code format, whether statically or dynamically linked; and (iii) other software that may be used to develop standalone products based on the Licensed Technology.

Our plugin doesn't contain engine tools, as they are different files and modified for the purpose of our open-source tool.
