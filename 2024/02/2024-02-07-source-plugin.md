**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The currently developed product is a plugin of the Unreal Engine game engine. It is being developed by [private] ([private]) to be sold on Marketplace.

It was made public for a short time (a few days) so a friend of mine could test it. However, since the project was not shared anywhere, it did not occur to me that it could be forked. Interestingly, the project was forked.

I hid the main project, but the forked project, that is, my codes, is now publicly available and I don't like it at all.

21 days ago I sent a message to the user CrashAngelArts on the [private]. However, he still did not take any action.

I believe I've waited long enough and that's why I'm submitting a DMCA report. I want this project to be removed or hidden. I plan to sell it on Marketplace soon, and having the codes publicly available will hurt sales.

CrashAngelArts can keep the codes if it wishes, but I do not want them to be published publicly.

Thank you.
