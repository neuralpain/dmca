**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All 18 repositories under https://github.com/fiea85s?tab=repositories should be removed.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The private [private] are located on a password-protected platform and can only be viewed and cloned with a password or a token. The suspected person was probably still in possession of an old token that allowed access to the [private].  
We have updated the tokens last week.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Unauthorized access to our private [private] and publication for the public on GitHub.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have found no forks right now.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GNU General Public License, version 2 or later

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

TYPO3 and the extensions are licensed under GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

However, the private [private] have been individually developed by us for our customers and contain customer data.  
They were downloaded without authorization.  
By publishing the [private], sensitive data such as user names, e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords were disclosed.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

All 18 repositories under https://github.com/fiea85s?tab=repositories should be removed completely.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We suspect a former [private] who previously uploaded software that was programmed in our company to GitHub.
A legal process is already underway with a cease-and-desist declaration regarding the publication of company information.
The lawyer has also already been informed about the incident reported here and initiated a criminal complaint.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
