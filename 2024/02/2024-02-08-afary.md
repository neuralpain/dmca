I am writing to submit a DMCA takedown notice for copyright infringement on the GitHub platform. I have identified an infringing repository that reproduces my copyrighted code without authorization. I have read and understood GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the copyright owner of the following repositories on GitHub:

URL: [https://github.com/Bahachairet/AfaryApif.git]  
I have discovered an infringing repository on GitHub:

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
