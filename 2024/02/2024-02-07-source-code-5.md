I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
 
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.
 
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
 
I believe that this repository, https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/woah-its-rex/tree/main, is infringing on my work, [private]. I recently changed [private] to be [private] so that the features I made wouldn't be copied, but after that the features were still directly copied to this repository. The only differences are that the format of certain things is changed, but they do the exact same thing. A majority of the things in the entirety of SpiritAxolotl's game also function the same way as the things from my game.
 
I can be contacted at [private] or [private]
[private]  
[private]
 
To remedy this, the user can delete the repository containing the copy of my game.
 
These features, which I will provide screenshots of in this message, include:  
- The entirety of the function pickaxeAbility13(); (name changed in other repository)  
- The entirety of the Pickaxe 12 crafting recipe (Wings of Glory)  
- Every original pickaxe name
 
The files attached will have names that correspond to the list above,
 
amber_pickaxe_ability is my pickaxe ability.  
amber_recipe is my recipe.  
amber_names are my pickaxe names.  
 
stolen_ability is the stolen pickaxe ability.  
stolen_recipe is the stolen recipe.  
stolen_names are the stolen pickaxe names.

Thank you for reading all of this!
