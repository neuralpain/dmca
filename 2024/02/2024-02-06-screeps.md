As a [private] of Screeps Team (https://github.com/screeps/), I am authorized to act on behalf of our players in matters pertaining to intellectual property rights associated with our gaming service. The copyrighted material in question comprises unique code developed by our players within the Screeps game environment. This code is an integral part of our service and is protected under copyright law. It was created exclusively by our players during their interaction with our game, making them the rightful owners of this intellectual property.

Due to the unauthorized and illicit nature of the code's acquisition and subsequent distribution, we are obligated and authorized to initiate actions to protect the copyright interests of our players. Our role as facilitators of the gaming service and custodians of our players' creative endeavors within this platform grants us the authority to act in this capacity. We hereby assert our responsibility to enforce the copyright protections afforded to our players' original works, which have been compromised through this unauthorized dissemination.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work in question consists of original computer programming code authored by players of the Screeps game. This code is a sophisticated and unique product of each player's individual creativity, strategy, and intellectual effort. It is specifically designed to interact with the Screeps gaming environment, enabling players to control their in-game entities and automate their gameplay strategies. As such, each player's code is a distinct and integral component of their gaming experience.

This proprietary code is developed within the protected Screeps platform, which is accessible only to registered users of our service. The code is stored and executed on our secure servers and is not publicly accessible outside the gaming environment. This ensures both the integrity of the gameplay and the protection of our players' intellectual property.

Unfortunately, we do not have a URL to the original location of the code within our service, as it is stored in a protected environment accessible only to individual players and the game's operational framework.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Players can only access their own code through a secure authentication process, which verifies their identity and ensures that no other users can view or interact with their code.
The execution of the player's code is handled exclusively by the game's [private]. This [private] operates in a closed system, preventing any external access or manipulation. The code is executed in a sandboxed environment, ensuring that it runs in isolation from other players' code and from the broader server environment.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is the result of a recently exploited security flaw in our system. This flaw, which has since been fixed, temporarily allowed unauthorized access to and copying of our players' game code, leading to its unauthorized distribution via the accused project.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
